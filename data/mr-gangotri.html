<br/>
                    Neelakanta Naidu (Prakash Raj) is a big factionist. He has 
                    a loyal confidant called Narasimha (Suman), who is willing 
                    to give his life for the sake of his master. After gap of 
                    many years, Neelakanta Naidu's wife gives a birth to a baby 
                    daughter. But all the earlier babies born to Neelakanta Naidu 
                    expired due to some unknown reason. The priests advise Neelakanta 
                    to name his daughter as 'Gangotri' (Aditi Agarwal). They also 
                    warn Neelakanta that the kid is having 'jalagandam', hence 
                    they ask Neelakanta to take Gangotri to the holy place of 
                    Gangotri in Himalayas and do the 'abhyangana snanam' (bath 
                    with turmeric, milk etc.) for the next 15 years. After 15 
                    years, Gangotri would be free of any dangers. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                    nobody could entertain the kid Gangotri; Simhadri (Allu Arjun) 
                    - the son of Narasimha - makes her smile by entertaining her 
                    with a song. Simhadri becomes a servant cum friend to Gangotri. 
                    They grow together. In the mean time mother of Simhadri (Seeta) 
                    sacrifices her life to save Neelakantam.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                    Gangotri attains puberty, Gangotri's aunt (Sakuntala) restricts 
                    Simhadri from meeting Gangotri. Gangotri and Simhadri realize 
                    that they fell in love. When Simhadri comes to Gangotri's 
                    place clandestinely to meet her, they are caught red-handed 
                    by Neelakantam. Neelakantam beats Simhadri. Meantime, Narasimha 
                    comes to the spot and interferes. This causes a rift between 
                    Neelakantam and his trusted lieutenant Narasimha. Neelakantam 
                    is misinformed about Narasimha's intentions; hence he bombs 
                    the house of Narasimha. Simhadri is away at that time. When 
                    Simhadri comes to know that Neelakantam is responsible for 
                    the bombing, he comes to Neelakantam's house and challenges 
                    that he would marry Gangotri in 365 days.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then 
                    Simhadri reaches Gangotri and waits for his ladylove to come 
                    to that place for the final 'abhyangana snanam' (sacred bath). 
                    The rest of the film is about how Simhadri and Gangotri unite 
                    together.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists</b>:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Allu 
                    Arjun</b>: Allu Arjun - the son of ace producer Allu Arvind 
                    and nephew of Megastar Chiranjeevi - is launched with a dream 
                    project directed by K Raghavendra Rao. On the looks front, 
                    Arjun is pretty average. He has shown the sparks of brilliancy 
                    with his histrionics in a few vital scenes (scene challenging 
                    Prakash Raj and the climax scene). He did well in sentiment 
                    scenes as well. His voice needs some toning and modulation. 
                    He looked odd wearing those knickers in the first half (pre-puberty 
                    days). In the second half (post-puberty days) he looked good. 
                    Every actor has weaknesses and strengths. Allu Arjun should 
                    choose roles that amplify his strength and nullify his weaknesses. 
                    But unfortunately, his main asset of dancing talent has gone 
                    unnoticed because of not having many mass tunes in this film. 
                    Vijayan composed good fights for Arjun in the climax.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Aditi 
                    Agarwal</b>: She looks pretty tender in the role of Gangotri. 
                    Since she has to be shown as a small girl in the first half, 
                    the glamour aspect was not touched. In the second half, she 
                    is glamorous in the song of '<a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('gangotri1.html','Mrugaraju','width=200,height=280')">Nuvvu 
                    Nenu Kalisunte</a>'. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Prakash 
                    Raj</b>: Prakash Raj gets the lion share of footage in this 
                    film. By now, Prakash Raj has done so many roles that he nothing 
                    new to offer when he attempt these kind of roles. However, 
                    there are a couple of scenes where he was fresh.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Others</b>: 
                    Suman is very smart in this film, but has a limited role to 
                    play. Seeta too has a short role, but she is at her best. 
                    Sunil made a special appearance as a master in this film. 
                    His dance (wearing a red shirt, red pants and white shoes) 
                    with Arjun for <a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('gangotri6.html','Mrugaraju','width=200,height=280')">Mavayyadi

                    a positive role.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                    Story - Screenplay</b>: Story of the film has few drawbacks:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. There 
                      is no justification about why Suman is willing to give his 
                      life to his master Prakash Raj, without bothering about 
                      his wife and son.<br/>
<br/>
                      2. When Suman had an argument with Prakash Raj and comes 
                      back, he is misinterpreted as he has joined hands with rivals 
                      of Prakash Raj. With that information Prakash Raj summons 
                      his goons to bomb Suman's house. But the real nature of 
                      Suman and his loyalty towards his master was not revealed 
                      to Prakash Raj through any character later. Hence this thread 
                      becomes an incomplete one.<br/>
<br/>
                      3. Seeta ties bells to the neck-thread of Suman so that 
                      he would listen to ringing of bells whenever he tries to 
                      kill somebody. Those ringing bells remind him of his family 
                      and hence discourage him from indulging in any violence. 
                      But later on, those same bells are tied to the wrist-thread 
                      of Arjun. Those bells mainly help him in fighting with the 
                      goons in the second half. Hence the bells, which were meant 
                      to preach non-violence, are used for violence. <br/>
<br/>
                      4. Since hero and heroine are childhood friends, the moments 
                      when they fall in love with each other and the incidents 
                      where their friendship turns into love relationship has 
                      to be shown very carefully. He established the scene of 
                      showing heroine's affection to hero very well (in stone 
                      throwing incident). But he did not have a gripping scene 
                      where and when the hero falls in love with heroine.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chinni 
                    Krishna has the habit of using a divine element in his stories. 
                    Likewise, this story mainly revolves on the holy place called 
                    'Gangotri' - the birthplace of river Ganges. In the first 
                    half, he has shown the elements of faction fights. But the 
                    second half takes a turn and rivalry shifts towards Prakash 
                    Raj and Arjun.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chinni 
                    Krishna has also given screenplay for the film. Screenplay 
                    of the film is pretty slow in the first half and erratic in 
                    the second half.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Direction</b>: 
                    When K Raghavendra Rao - the legend of Telugu cinema - directs 
                    his 100th venture - the expectations are pretty high. And 
                    it's very difficult for anybody to satisfy that kind of expectations. 
                    K Raghavendra Rao is known for his exceptional handling of 
                    songs department. His mark is evident in all songs. He is 
                    also pretty good at inserting songs into storyline without 
                    disturbing the flow. He managed well in establishing the characters 
                    in the first half. But he could not handle the second half 
                    of the film in a proper manner. The climax should have been 
                    better. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Dialogues by Viswanath are good. He should have added more

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                    The main asset of the film is mellifluous and melodious tunes

                      (Gangotri and Simhadri). By the time the song is completed, 
                      the kids grow up.<br/>

                      Arjun did extremely well in the female get-up. The way he 
                      seduces and dances with Sunil is superb. This is the best 
                      mass song of the film. Lawrence choreography helped this 
                      song a lot.<br/>

                      showing symbolism. When heroine attains puberty, the camera 
                      moves on to a flourished flower. Hero comes to entertain 
                      heroine's 'pushpavati function' by singing a song on heroine 
                      by comparing her to a flower.<br/>

                      used all kinds of fruits in this song for a great effect. 
                      Allu Arjun does a couple of mass steps in this song. This 
                      songs comes as a separation song with heroine in AP and 
                      hero in Gangotri.<br/>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    Photography by Chota K Naidu is excellent. He captured the 
                    beauty of Gangotri and other holy places with camera and presented 
                    us with the virtual tour of holy places.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production:</b> 
                    The movie comes from the stable of two of the most prestigious 
                    producers of Telugu cinema - Aswini Dutt and Allu Arvind. 
                    The production values are very rich.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    <br/>
                    First half of the film is decent as it establishes basic characters. 
                    But the tempo has not picked up in the second half. Hence 
                    the second half has become very slow. The climax of lead pair 
                    going into unconsciousness (or death?) and coming back to 
                    life again is not appealing. Over all its an average film. 
                    The plus points of the film are the good songs followed by 
                    photography. The minus point of the film is lack of comedy 
                    (except for Sunil's episode and AVS episode). We have to wait 
                    and see how this summer release is going to quench the thirst 
                    of Box Office.</font></p>
