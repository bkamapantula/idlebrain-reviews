                    is a wayward orphan who rescues Chandra Mohan of a gruesome 
                    accident. The impressed Chandra Mohan family members(consisting 
                    of Chandramohan wife&lt;Prabha&gt; and their kid Krishna) 
                    gives hostage to Vamsi. These two kids share a good number 
                    of vibes and turns out to be very good thick friends.<br/>
<br/>
                    As the time passes by Vamsi(Naveen) and Krishna(Srikanth) 
                    become inseparable. Though these two friends are close enough 
                    Vamsi is in no position to get his close buddy away from the 
                    habit of boozing.<br/>
<br/>
                    Seeta is a small time village belle who comes to Hyderabad 
                    for searching a job. Vamsi interviews her for his company 
                    and duly falls in love. When Seeta is going back to her village, 
                    she is spotted by dipsomaniac Vamsi, who gives her a lift 
                    to Railway station and takes her to remote place to malign 
                    her. When the inevitable thing is about to happen, Seeta escapes 
                    the scene by banging a brick Vamsi on his head.<br/>
<br/>
                    Later on Vamsi realizes the impact of consuming liquor and 
                    vow to say bye to his boozing habit Meantime the family of 
                    Chandra Mohan visits the marriage of Chandra Mohan old time 
                    pal Chalapathi Rao. Vamsi meets his soul stirring lass Seeta 
                    again. And expresses his wish to marry her. But Vamsi and 
                    Krishna have taken a vow to select girl for each other. Now 
                    it's Vamsi turn to OK Seeta for Krishna. When these two people(Vamsi 
                    and Seeta) face each other, they could recollect the whole 
                    flashback that transpired between them. Vamsi OKs Seeta for 
                    Krishna followed by a marriage.<br/>
<br/>
                    Seeta hates Vamsi for what he has done to her in the past 
                    and decides to make his life miserable by her clever manipulations. 
                    She do not believe that Vamsi is a changed man now. As the 
                    hatred and revenge in Seeta is growing day by day, the repenting 
                    agony in Vamsi sours to new heights. If you want to know what 
                    this different sensitive film has to offer in the climax, 
                    you must watch this film on the big silver screen to appreciate 
                    EVV's first venture as a full-time producer.</font></p>

<td colspan="2">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><br/>
                    Artists:</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Srikanth:</b> Srikanth found to be third time lucky with 
                    a good role to go with good story after 'Preyasi Raave' and 
                    'Kshemamga Velli Labhamga Randi'. He character is an easy 
                    going one, but takes a swift shift in the end to give completeness 
                    to it. Srikanth excelled well in that role.<br/>
<b>Naveen:</b> Success seems to be eluding Naveen though he 
                    is not erring in his selection of projects. But this time 
                    he got everything right including the much elusive success. 
                    He did exceedingly well in portraying the repenting mass character.<br/>
<b></b><b> Malavika:</b> Malavika is not an extraordinary 
                    beauty. That's reason why she is selected for this film. She 
                    looks just like the girl next door with her innocent smile 
                    and sensuality of a female. She did well to balance the showing 
                    of love towards srikanth and showing of hatred towards Naveen 
                    in presence of Srikanth and let him not know about the existing 
                    rivalry between Naveen and her.<br/>
<b>Asha:</b> She did well in her insignificant, yet important, 
                    character. A steamy song showcases her dare to bare attitude.<br/>
<b>LB Sriram:</b> The ultimate killer in this film is LB Sriram 
                    (He is dialogue write who worked for films like Hitler and 
                    Hello Brother). He provided the same kind of impact that is 
                    provided by Rao Gopal Rao in 'Muthyala Muggu'. His Godari 
                    accent is a treat to ears. He is an excellent stage artist. 
                    Just like most of the stage artist, his strength lies in body 
                    gestures and pronunciation of Telugu. Though he is done a 
                    few insignificant roles in films like 'Kishkinda Kanda' and 
                    'Hands Up', this film helped him as a launching pad into the 
                    popularity. He is supposed have grabbed half a dozen films 
                    with his performance in this film. His lingo 'Pusukkuna' makes 
                    people laugh uncontrollably. A new comedy star is born with 
                    this film.<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>
<b>Other Departments</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Direction:</b> EVV proved that stamina of small big film 
                    with 'Chala Bagundi'. He gave us a complete product in the 
                    form of 'Chala Bagundi'. He direction takes a new dimension 
                    in terms of slickness in this film. In the earlier films the 
                    comedy angle of the film takes unproportionate stretch and 
                    there by kills the pace of story. But in this film clean comedy 
                    is projected in the right proportion in the form of LB Sriram. 
                    Just like his earlier films, Sentiment is 'Chala Bagundi' 
                    plus point.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> Music is this film is very good. Koti gave good 
                    music for EVV and EVV relayed excessively on Koti for his 
                    films. Re-recording is very good in this film as it is done 
                    in DTS format.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Dialogues:</b> Janardhan Maharshi gave good sensible dialogue 
                    with EVV flavor.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Production:</b> The reason given by EVV for transforming 
                    himself as the producer is that he want to have a free hand 
                    at the budget of the film. He spent around 3.5 crores and 
                    all that money is shown in the form of richness on the screen. 
                    He quoted high for the distributors and finally he released 
                    the film himself in Andhra area and taken the help of Geeta 
                    Distributor to release this film in Nizam. After the release 
                    of the film distributors are queuing up to buy the rights 
                    of films outright.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EVV has 
                    a habit of giving lot of prerelease hype before the release 
                    of his films. He followed the same strategy for the last two 
                    films 'Pilla Nachindi' and 'Neti gandhi'. This time too he 
                    did the same by giving high blitz publicity. But this time 
                    he got another thing right in addition to good publicity. 
                    That is to make a film that is worth the publicity he gives. 
                    People like Chiru and Rama Naidu publicly acknowledge their 
                    personal opinion about 'Chala Bagundi'. EVV has the most powerful 
                    weapon as the publicity vehicle. That is a satisfied viewer. 
                    And all the people who watched this film are giving good feed 
                    back. And this mouth publicity is just doing what it is supposed
