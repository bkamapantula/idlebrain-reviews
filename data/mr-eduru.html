<br/>
                    Surya Murthy (Nag) is the head of a village where he is respected 
                    with a lot of reverence by the entire village except for the 
                    trouble shooting Nazar. Surya Murthy stays with his grandfather 
                    (Satyanarayana) and grandmother (Showkar Janaki) and a 6-year-old 
                    girl Vaani. He has a younger look-a-like brother Satya Murthy 
                    (Nag again) in Hyderabad completing his engineering in computer 
                    science. Satya Murthy has a non-Telugu-speaking girl friend 
                    Sri (Shehnaz).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Satya 
                    Murthy has a worrying factor now. His elder brother Surya 
                    Murthy has decided not to marry in his life. Hence Satya Murthy 
                    starts looking for a suitable bride for his elder brother. 
                    There he meets Vasundhara (Soundarya) at a temple and decides 
                    that she is the right choice for his elder brother. He approaches 
                    Vasundhara and asks her hand for marrying his elder brother. 
                    Later on, Vasundhara happen to observe the heroism and goodness 
                    in Surya Murthy when he comes to Hyderabad to meet Satya Murthy. 
                    </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later 
                    on Vasundhara comes to know that Surya Murthy and Satya Murthy 
                    are the younger brothers of the man who married his elder 
                    sister Yamuna. Yamuna tells Vasundhara that Surya Murthy played 
                    a villain role in their life and he was instrumental in her 
                    husband dying after prolonged boozing due the compounding 
                    problems. She also tells that after her husband's demise, 
                    Surya Murthy forcibly took away her daughter Vaani.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    coming to know about her elder sisters flashback, Vasundhara 
                    decides to take revenge by marrying Surya Murthy and then 
                    slowly destroy the entire family. She accepts the proposal 
                    of Satya Murthy to marry his brother Surya Murthy. Then they 
                    start doing a drama by making Vasundhara stay in the village 
                    of Satya Murthy and creating situations where Vasundhara saves 
                    Vaani from the perils.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    the repetitive requests from his family members and Vaani, 
                    Surya Murthy marries Vasundhara. First step of Vasundhara 
                    after marriage was to postpone the first night by 22 days 
                    by bribing the priest. Then she transfers the money and jewelry 
                    to his sister's house with the help of a petty thief. But 
                    that thief runs away without giving jewelry to her sister 
                    and gets caught by the police. Meantime, Satya Murthy realizes 
                    the intentions of his <i>bhabhi</i> Vasundhara and explains 
                    her the flashback of Vaani and tells her that it was Yamuna 
                    who was a characterless lady. By the time Vasundhara realizes 
                    the fault of her, the thief was presented in the house of 
                    Surya Murthy and was interrogated about who give him jewelry. 
                    To save his <i>bhabhi</i>, Satya Murthy behaves in a strange 
                    manner and tells Surya Murthy that he wants his partnership 
                    in the property. He tells that he stolen the jewelry and want 
                    the thief to sell that off so that he can start his software 
                    business (all college passouts can get some ideas about putting 
                    a startup after watching this film).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
                    that incident, the brothers split. The rest of the film is 
                    about how the brothers get united and decimate the villain 
                    gang.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Performances:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nagarjuna:</b> 
                    Nag did essay both of these roles with fine performance. You 
                    can see a brand new Nag in a never-seen-before get-up in the 
                    form of Surya Murthy. Even the role of Satya Murthy is also 
                    equally powerful. All the people who does criticize nag that 
                    he can't act in matured roles can take a hike and watch Nag 
                    giving wonderful performance as Surya Murthy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Soundarya:</b> 
                    She is at her best in this tailor made role. But her not-so-pure 
                    Telugu-speaking accent is going to cause the listeners a bit 
                    of disgruntling. But she did do her part of contribution with 
                    great ease.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Shehnaz</b>: 
                    She did prove that a successful anchor might not become a 
                    successful actress. Her role in this film is very artificial. 
                    So is her acting. Much to the discomfort of the viewers, her 
                    role speaks only English and a few badly accented Telugu words 
                    in between.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay 
                    &amp; direction</b>: Jonnalagadda Srinivasa Rao, the debutant 
                    director, did show his mettle in a few sentimental scenes 
                    and the portrayal of the character Surya Murthy. But he is 
                    insensible in handling class scenes. He tried to give a mass 
                    appeal to the film, which made this film lose its sophistication. 
                    The director has poor taste in selecting the colors. He preferred 
                    black and maroon attires with zari edge to it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                    D Siva Prasad Reddy is a lover of mass film. Checkout his 
                    track record with Nag. Film Vicky Dada was a mass film. Allari 
                    Alludu was a super hit and a massive mass treat for the viewers. 
                    Auto Driver was a mass film that bombed at the box-office. 
                    Seeta Rama Raju too is a mass film that drew mixed reactions. 
                    Likewise, this film too tends to be another mass film. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                    Audio of this film is a weakling. But the background music 
                    is good. The background music of the scenes where Surya Murthy 
                    walks is outstanding. 'Enaadina Anukunnana' and 'Dam Dama 
                    Dam' are good in this film as they are inserted in the gripping 
                    part of the story. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis:</b> 
                    This film fallows the trend of <i>Bobbili Brahmanna</i>, <i>Peda 
                    Rayudu</i> and <i>Peddannayya</i> where the hero played the 
                    duel role as bothers. One is the head of village and other 
                    one is posh guy with <i>phir-bhi-dil-hain-hindustani</i> attitude. 
                    This film also showcases the freedom Nag gives to his director 
                    in the filmmaking. LB Sriram provides some relief with his 
                    comedy. Full of sentiments and sacrifices, this film is targeted 
                    the mass viewers. But the questions is weather the viewers 
                    appreciate the routine time tested formula of the village-head 
                    kind of characters again and again. This film may get negative 
                    talk in 'A' centers. Fate of 'Eduruleni Manishi' would depend 
                    on how the mass audiences embrace it in B and C centers. </font></p>
