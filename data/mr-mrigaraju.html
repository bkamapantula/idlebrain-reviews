<br/>
                    There is a village called Adavipalli in the midst of the jungle 
                    where the land is having lot of ores. Since it is located 
                    between two hills, the government wanted to construct a railway 
                    bridge to gap the commutation and make the transfer of goods 
                    easier. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                    that jungle, there lives a man-eating lion. The latest victim 
                    of lions havoc is the death of the chief engineer who is constructing 
                    the rail bridge. The Railway department asks Aishwarya (Simran) 
                    to go on the mission of constructing the bridge. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even 
                    after Aishwarya resumes the duty, Lion starts terrorizing 
                    the crew of the construction team. The ace hunter of Adavipalli, 
                    Raju (Chiru), is entrusted with the job of hunting the lion. 
                    The rest of the first half is all about how Raju traps the 
                    lion and kill it at the cost of Appanna Dora (Nagababu). But, 
                    the other lion in the jungle gets enraged at Raju for killing 
                    its companion. There is another trouble for the bridge project 
                    in the form of forest ranger (Surya) and a local smuggler 
                    (Ramireddy). Raju gets rid of these two goons by the interval. 
                    Then the viewers are revealed that Aishwarya is the wife of 
                    Raju.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                    the second half, the flashback is revealed. Raju comes to 
                    city to participate in the crafts mela to sell his herbs from 
                    the jungle. There he meets Aishwarya, who is come to visit 
                    a fun stall along with his fiancée Vicky (Raja Ravindra). 
                    When Aishwarya tries to take a shot at shooting the balloon, 
                    Vicky disappoints her saying that she cannot do it. Raju, 
                    who is an onlooker comes forwards and gives her confidence 
                    and tips to shoot. Then Aishwarya's bullet hits the bull's 
                    eye. Impressed with Raju's help, she invites him to come to 
                    her engagement. At the engagement, Raju spots Vicky flirting 
                    with another girl and tells him about the importance of being 
                    a good human being. Aishwarya watches the entire episode from 
                    the behind and she decides that Raju is a loyal man compared 
                    to the flirtatious Vicky. And she seeks for Raju's hand and 
                    then they get married. The father of Aishwarya cunningly separates 
                    the couple by creating misunderstandings. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    rest of the film is about how the hunter Raju and engineer 
                    Aishwarya sort out the matters and complete the construction 
                    of the bridge.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Performances</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chiru</b>: 
                    first half of the film does not have more scope for performance, 
                    as there are only a few scenes between Chiru and Simran and 
                    his pranks. But in the flashback, Chiru did a fine act. His 
                    dances, as usual, are the best.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Simran</b>: 
                    Simran's character here got a few shades that of her Yuvaraju 
                    character, which is also happens to be the mother of a kid. 
                    She did her bit with finesse.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sanghvi</b>: 
                    She did a trivial role in this film, which does not help her 
                    anyway to get more projects as Asha Saini is taking the center 
                    stage as the second heroine in today's Telugu cinema.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other 
                    departments</b>:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Story</b>: 
                    This story is a straight lift from 'Ghost and the Darkness'. 
                    Unfortunately, this secret was leaked to the press way back 
                    in February of 2000. And the opportunists tried to cash in 
                    by buying the remake rights of 'Ghost and the Darkness' and 
                    threatened to release the remake two days before Mrigarju. 
                    As the story is simple and straight and do not justify the 
                    movie's length of 2 and half hours, a flashback story was 
                    created to fill in one hour. The original originator of this 
                    inspired story was Jayant. He was roped in to make a film 
                    for Devi films in December 1998. But he was swapped with Gunasekhar 
                    by Vyjayanti movies, that has planned to do another unofficial 
                    remake of 'An Affair to remember' (Ravoyi Chandamama) with 
                    Nag. Later on Nagababu developed the story line and then Yandamuri 
                    Veerendranath and Satyanand roped in to give the final touches. 
                    The result is a desi 'Ghost and the Darkness'.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay</b>: 
                    As story is plain and simple, a lot would depend upon screenplay 
                    to make the film gripping and interesting. But Guna Sekhar 
                    failed stitch the scenes in perfect manner. And he tried to 
                    ape the original film in most of the scenes, which resulted 
                    in poor copying as we lack the special FX finesse the Hollywood 
                    boast of. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Direction</b>: 
                    The director is the caption of ship. And Guna Sekhar tried 
                    to steer the ship towards the route of the 'Ghost and Darkness' 
                    rather than by following the wind. Even in 'Vamsi', B Gopal 
                    tried the same thing by getting too much inspired by the original 
                    and ignoring the basics. This movie does not have any drawbacks 
                    if you look from an average viewer point of view. But it definitely 
                    lacks what a typical Telugu cinema viewer looks for.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                    Devi Vara Prasad needs to be commended for the kind of confidence 
                    he had in project by investing 15 crores. He spent 75 lacs 
                    on a single set for the Hungama song. He spent another 30 
                    lacs to recreate the Amsterdam city in Annapurna studios. 
                    He has taken the entire unit to South Africa to shoot scenes 
                    with lion and then spent a fortune on Pentamedia Graphics 
                    to recreate the some of the lion scene. He had accomplished 
                    his goal of making a rich high budget film with chiru in the 
                    Hollywood standard. But what we have to see is if the Telugu 
                    people are willing to embrace these kinds of films.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Songs</b>: 
                    Like any other movies, songs in this film are as good as the 
                    sequence of the scenes in which they are inserted. Chai song 
                    is the highlight of the film and an absolute treat for eyes 
                    and ears. The next best song is 'Ramayya Paadaletti' in which 
                    he made a superb step that is as good as the one he did in 
                    'Abibi' song of Hitler. Third best is 'Satamana' slow song! 
                    The other songs are routine songs. Mani Sharma did an inferior 
                    job compared his earlier contributions to chiru like Bavagaroo, 
                    Choodalani Vundi, Iddaru Mitrulu and Annayya. Even the background 
                    flavor of the film is of Hollywood genre, which may not be 
                    very appealing for the Telugu viewers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Camera 
                    Work</b>: Camera work is good. But there are a lot of flaws 
                    in canning the scenes as the jungle is shot in different locations 
                    and it shows up breaking the uniformity of presenting the 
                    feel the jungle. In a few songs the light is dark. Sekhar 
                    V Joseph had done the cinematography for this film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Satyanand, who gave dialogues for Annayya has given dialogues 
                    for this film too. He excels in the scenes in which Chiru 
                    does comedy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    As the 60% of the film involves jungle and people may feel 
                    uncomfortable viewing the slow paced Jungle action. Another 
                    drawback of the film is fights. There is only one fight in 
                    the entire film. As the people expect a grandeur climax between 
                    lion and Chiru, Chiru eliminates the lion with one stab. The 
                    initial part of flashback episode is a big relief. This film 
                    is an attempt to make a Hollywood kind of film (that's too 
                    inspired by a Hollywood film) in Andhra Pradesh, which may 
                    suffer the problem of nativity. The box office fate of this 
                    film will be decided in a couple of weeks, though some of 
                    the people started writing off the film on the day one. If 
                    we go by the weight of the film, it may not become a hit. 
                    But this film sports Chiranjeevi, who has the history and 
                    ability of turning the average flicks into blockbusters.</font></p>
