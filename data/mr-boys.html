<br/>
                          There are five teenage boys who are very thick friends. 
                          They have typical teen-boy fantasies - proposing to 
                          each and every chick they come across, touching women 
                          in crowded areas, boozing, browsing porn books, trying 
                          for call girls etc. In the process they meet a girl 
                          Harini (Genelia). A guy called Munna (Nakul) from these 
                          boys group fall in love with her and she also loves 
                          him. After coming to know about it, the parents separate 
                          the boy, girl and the friends. The boy and the girl 
                          get desperate and elope to Tirupati to get married.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                          parents throw them out of their houses. The friends 
                          also come out to support this young couple. They all 
                          work together to make a living. They find their strengths 
                          and hidden talents. They form a band called 'Boys'. 
                          Sign a contract with Sony Music and win M TV awards. 
                          In the process, small differences crop up between the 
                          wedded couple and they fall out. The rest of the film 
                          is all about how they get united with the help of friends!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists 
                          Performance<br/>
</b>The specialty of the guys selected for Boys is that 
                          all guys are normal looking. There are lean guys and 
                          fat guys as well. Everybody suited their character well. 
                          All the characters are established in a strong way. 
                          Siddardh is the hero of the film. He is sensible. Harini 
                          (Genelia D'souza) acts as the heroine and she has an 
                          array of emotions to go through in this film. She has 
                          the mannerism of showing finger to guys. But they have 
                          made her rise the other finger instead of the middle 
                          one to avoid the scissors of censor officers. Vivek 
                          did a meaty role as the mentor of the boys. He offered 
                          lots of comedy. Actor Rajendra Prasad did the dubbing 
                          for Vivek. And because of the good dubbing, the comedy 
                          timing of Vivek character worked out well.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                          Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                          Story:</b> The story of the film is a very typical one. 
                          Boy meets the girl. Parents reject their love and separate 
                          them. The boy-girl elope and get married. They come 
                          out and make a living and prove to the world that the 
                          word 'love' is not a taboo as projected by parents and 
                          one can do good career even when one fell in love. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay 
                          - direction:</b> Shankar - who directed five consecutive 
                          super hits in a row - attempted his sixth film 'Boys'. 
                          Director Shankar has the habit of making social-message 
                          films and teen films alternatively. Checkout his filmography: 
                          Gentleman (social), Premikudu (love), Bharateeyudu (social), 
                          Jeans (love), Oke Okkadu (social) and Boys (love). And 
                          if you analyze, his social films have become sensational 
                          hits as his love films turned out to be just hits. Like 
                          his earlier love films, this film also has got good 
                          narration, great youth elements, much needed sentiment 
                          and interesting screenplay. But the narration of the 
                          film is little slow. Shankar's projection of deeds done 
                          boys is little embarrassing to look on the screen (in 
                          1st half), though it happens in real life.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                          Music is the life of this film. AR Rehman came up with 
                          great tunes with rich percussion and orchestration. 
                          His background music is equally titillating. There are 
                          two more songs in the film which were not there in audio 
                          album. One is about making music using props like spoon, 
                          pot etc (without using musical instruments). But the 
                          scene-stealer is the 'please' song that aimed by 'boys' 
                          at wooing the manager of Sony Music. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Songs 
                          picturization</b>: All the songs in this film are picturised 
                          on a larger than life format by using lots of computer 
                          graphics and visual effects. The backdrop chosen for 
                          each song is excellent. The choreography adds to the 
                          beauty of the visuals.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                          Photography by Ravi K Chandran is pleasing to our eyes. 
                          The colors, lighting effects, movement of the camera 
                          etc. are just perfect.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                          Dialogues by Sri Rama Krishna are good, though some 
                          of the dialogues in the first half put the parents into 
                          embarrassment (youth likes it anyway).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                          AM Ratnam spent 24 crores in making this film. And all 
                          that money is efficiently transformed in to rich visuals 
                          and abundant music in cinema halls. This film would 
                          remain as one of the proud films produced by AM Ratnam.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                          <br/>
                          'Boys' is an urbane and youth film. Taking a simple 
                          point, Shankar succeeded in narrating it with an interesting 
                          screenplay. The plus points in the film are good music, 
                          rich visuals and youth elements. The weakness of the 
                          film is slow narration and lack of mass elements. Though 
                          the film went in to weak mode at times, the director 
                          Shankar made sure that the narration is back on the 
                          wheels as the climax approached. The parents are shown 
                          in a bad light in this film (parents are shown as inflexible 
                          ones who does not understand their kids. There are good 
                          parents in real who understand, appreciate and encourage 
                          their kids to succeed in love and career). This film 
                          would definitely become a hit. This youth-rich film 
                          would do well in A centers. The question now is whether 
                          it does well in B and C centers or not!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Tailpiece</b>: 
                          I added a clause along with my rating that goes like 
                          'Can kids watch this film?'. I would definitely recommend 
                          'Boys' to kids and teenage guys. But I do warn the parents 
                          not to watch this film along with their teenage son/daughters, 
                          because it would put you in to embarrassment. When you 
                          watch this film (especially the first half), make sure 
                          that your kids are not around. The theaters in AP are 
                          crowded with 90% of youth on the opening show today!</font></p>
