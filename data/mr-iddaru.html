<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chiru 
                    and Saakshi (Iddaru Mitrulu or IM) tease each other very much 
                    and at the same time, they love (as a friend) each other so 
                    much. At one point of time, Chandra Mohan expresses his wish 
                    to get IM married to each other, which they jocularly refuse 
                    and say that they are just friends. One fine day Chiru spots 
                    Ramya at a shopping complex and gets attracted to her. He 
                    confesses to Saakshi that there is something about Ramya. 
                    She gives him a few tips over pataoing a gal. Ultimately Chiru 
                    succeeds in wooing Ramya. They get married with the consent 
                    of their parents (who happens to be childhood buddies). Ramya 
                    get little suspicious about the relationship between IM right 
                    on the day of marriage. Suresh, an ace ad photographer follows 
                    Saakshi and succeeds in impressing upon her. She sends Chiru 
                    as messenger for their marriage after taking opinion of Chiru 
                    about their love. Saakshi and Suresh ends up in tying the 
                    knots. After a few days, Saakshi finds Suresh flirting with 
                    one of his! ! model girl. When confronted about this Suresh 
                    tells her that nature of ad business demands such a type of 
                    intimate flirting sessions. Chiru comes to know about this 
                    from Saakshi and go to Suresh place to warn him. Suresh rebuffs 
                    questioning relationship between IM. Chiru feels helpless 
                    as IM are just friends and share no blood relationship. Suresh 
                    insults later Chandra Mohan when he tries to rectify him, 
                    which leads a fight between Suresh and Chiru. Exasperated 
                    by this incident Suresh pains Saakshi's heart by alleging 
                    an illegitimate affair between IM and drags Saakshi out of 
                    his house on the rainy night. Chiru spots Saakshi on the road 
                    and try to console her, which is witnessed by Ramya. <br/>
<br/>
                    INTERVAL <br/>
<br/>
                    Saakshi is staying with her dad. Ramya starts treating Chiru 
                    indifferently since she spotted both of them in a suggestive 
                    pose. Saakshi realizes that she is pregnant. One night, when 
                    Ramya and Chiru are getting ready for a cozy romance during 
                    late night, Chiru receives a call from Saakshi's house cleaner 
                    that she is fallen from stairs and she is in critical position. 
                    Chiru immediately leaves to Saakshi's house after explaining 
                    the situation to Ramya. Ramya felt frustrated after Chiru 
                    leaves her abruptly in the middle of romance. Later Ramya 
                    gives Chiru an option to choose between her and Saakshi. Chiru 
                    happily opts for friend to wife. This is the last straw and 
                    Ramya leaves to her parent's place after encouraged by her 
                    mother to teach Chiru a lesson. Saakshi, unaware of the widening 
                    gap between Ramya and Chiru, is reaching close to her delivery 
                    date. Chiru come to know about Saakshi's innate desire for 
                    a "Seemantham". He arranges a Seemantham for her. Later Suresh 
                    looses hi! ! s position of ace photographer to another person 
                    and realizes the importance of Saakshi. As the movie reaches 
                    climax, Saakshi comes to know about that gap she created between 
                    Chiru and Ramya by her. When Saakshi go to Ramya's house to 
                    convince Ramya about the relationship between IM, Vijaya and 
                    Ramya insult her. While coming back to home, Saakshi is bumped 
                    by a car. Chiru admits Saakshi in hospital. By this time Suresh 
                    enters the hospital to forcibly take her to his home. Suresh 
                    try to do abortion to Saakshi thinking that the reason for 
                    pregnancy is Chiru. Chiru come just in time to save Saakshi. 
                    Then the chase of cars begun, which ultimately ends up in 
                    an accident that leads to Chiru saving the life Suresh. Suresh 
                    then realizes the IM relationship. Later Ramya too realizes 
                    her fault. Hence, the movie ends up as Mugguru Mitrulu with 
                    saakshi's kid joining the existing IM and making it MM. </font></p>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Actors:</b> 
                  This story mainly revolves around Chiru and Saakshi. Chiru excelled 
                  well in his role of soft portrayal, sans heroism. Ramya role 
                  has very little importance in second half. Sudhakar played a 
                  role of Saakshi and Chiru's buddy, who has the habit of telling 
                  only truths, there by leaking the valuable information at the 
                  critical times. Ramya and Saakshi excelled in their roles. But 
                  its hard to see the glamour doll Saakshi in a sentimental role 
                  (a la Rachana in Bavagaru . ). Chandra Mohan, AVS and Vijaya 
                  justified their roles of limited exploitation. Rambha acted(danced) 
                  in a very well pictured mass song as hip shaker and pelvis thrasher.<b><br/>
<br/>
</b> Direction: It is a very atypical of Raghavendra Rao and 
                  Chiru combination to select such a soft story. He did not do 
                  complete justice to direction as he seem to have lost his grip 
                  over subject during the last two reels. Muthaya Subbaiah or 
                  Jayanth would have handled this story in a better manner. He 
                  hurried at the end giving a complete anti-climax. Did u watch 
                  any movie, which does not have a fight to end the movie with? 
                  <br/>
<br/>
                  Music: ManiSharma produced excellent backdrop music and melodious 
                  cum fast tract songs. <br/>
<br/>
                  Screenplay: Screenplay is shabby. There is no continuity in 
                  the story. <br/>
<br/>
                  Fights: There are only two fights in the movie and the fight 
                  is between Chiru and Suresh. This story gives no scope for fight 
                  sequences. </font></td>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                  role of Chiru suits the likes of Jagapathi Babu and Shobhan 
                  Babu. There is absolutely no Heroism in this role. Chiru fans 
                  (First day matinee crowds) are slightly disappointed with the 
                  movie. Only song which made them dance in the movie hall is 
                  "Hey Rukku Rukku Maa'm". Fate of this movie depends on how family 
                  audiences receive the movie. Even at the time of "Bavagarooo 
                  .." audiences felt that the role of Hero is best suited to Rajendra 
                  Prasad to Chiru. Lets wait for the final verdict by Andhra Audiences
