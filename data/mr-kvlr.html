<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Srikanth, 
                    Rajendra Prasad and Brahmanandam are mechanics in a car company. 
                    Roja, Preethi and Kovai Sarala are their wives respectively. 
                    These three families live in the same neighborhood. All the 
                    three mechanics are wayward husbands. Their weakness lies 
                    in boozing and spending half of their salary on the unnecessary 
                    items. Their wives have a tough time running their houses 
                    with the meager money provided by their men. They could not 
                    pay rent, ration money and school fees of their kids.<br/>
<br/>
                    At this juncture of time another pair ,Ramya Krishna and Prakash 
                    Raj, lands up in their neighbor house. Ramya Krishna, a pure 
                    Brahmin lady is supposed to have inter-caste married Prakash 
                    Raj. Both of them do their jobs and share their housework.<br/>
<br/>
                    Inspired by Ramyakrishna's double income strategy, these wives 
                    ask their husband for a permission to work outside. Being 
                    male chauvinists, they firmly oppose wives plea as they feel 
                    that the right place for any married women is kitchen and 
                    wives life should be dedicated to taking care of husband and 
                    raising kids. They think that man should be the sole bread 
                    winner for any family. Money earned by a woman is untouchable.<br/>
<br/>
                    As a compromise the women ask their men to give the entire 
                    salary to them on the 1st of the month so that they can manage 
                    the house and save money for the future. But these men have 
                    lot of debts and installments to pay. They thought that they 
                    can pay all their debts when they receive Diwali bonus. To 
                    their chagrin, there is a rift between the workers union and 
                    the management that result in nonpayment of bonus. Enraged 
                    men fight with the owners that resulted these guys losing 
                    up jobs.<br/>
<br/>
                    After coming to know about this, the wives decides to take 
                    up a job that creates rifts between the spouses which results 
                    in wives living separately in another apartments. If you want 
                    to know how the husbands realize the importance of their wives, 
                    you got to watch this humor filled message oriented film.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><br/>
                    Artists:</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Brahmanandam:</b> Brahmanandam has the reputation of pulling 
                    crowds to the theaters by the sheer fact that he is starring 
                    in that film. But this film is something else. He is given 
                    more footage in the film and he gracefully carried the responsibility 
                    of providing the wholesome entertainment with his histrionics.<br/>
<b>Kovai Sarala:</b> A perfect match to Brahmanandam in all 
                    aspects. Her tamilian accent and sarcastic expressions make 
                    a hilarious comedy.<br/>
<b></b><b> Rajendra Prasad:</b> Rajendra Prasad is given less 
                    footage in the first half and relatively reasonable footage 
                    in the second half. He did his part with élan. There 
                    is one particular bit in which the whole theater go into ruptures.<br/>
<b>Roja:</b> She is given a role sensible wife for which she 
                    did justice.<br/>
<b>Srikanth:</b> He does a role that does not have a proper 
                    sensibility or conviction. He is totally overshadowed by Brahmanandam's 
                    comic antics and Rajendra Prasad sensible stuff. <br/>
<b>Preethi:</b> She did the role of wife to Rajendra Prasad. 
                    Her role mostly a submissive one. He looks pretty glamorous 
                    too. <br/>
<b>Ramya Krishna:</b> She did a very good role of 'Baby' that 
                    enlightens the thinking of wives. Its sad that this glamour 
                    doll does not have much to exhibit it in this role. She is 
                    seen clad in <i>Pattu</i> sarees all the time. Her Brahmin 
                    accent is cute.<br/>
<b>Prakash Raj:</b> Prakash Raj has come full circle with 
                    this film. He donned the role of preacher in 'Manasichi Choodu'. 
                    And then onwards, all his films have a few preaching by him. 
                    Eventually, by the time the same banner produced another film, 
                    his preaching looks jaded.<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>
<b>Other Departments</b><br/>
<b><br/>
                    Story</b>: This film has a good message oriented story.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Direction:</b> As this débutante, Raja Vannem Reddy, 
                    deals with a serious subject he had to resort to convey the 
                    message through humor. He did exceptionally well in depicting 
                    humorous scenes. He has the knack of EVV and SV Krishna Reddy 
                    in dealing with comedy scenes. But it looks like he got carried 
                    away with the comedy and diluted the story part of it. For 
                    a new comer this film is good enough to show his/her class.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> Vandematharam gave hummable songs in this films. 
                    'Aadavallamandi Medu' is good. 'Lovvu Age Barunda Ranganayaki' 
                    is the icing on cake with Lawrance and Alphonsa doing very 
                    good dancing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Dialogues:</b> Rajendra Kumar came up with good dialogues 
                    in this film. His comedy punch is amazing.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Production:</b> Editor Mohan is best known for his quality 
                    and commitment for his story. He came up with another sugar 
                    coated capsule (Comedy Oriented Message Film).</font></p>

<td colspan="2">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This film 
                    is a message oriented film. In order to convey the message 
                    in a mild manner, the producer opted for an out and out comedy 
                    flick. In the beginning we start thinking that this film has 
                    two objectives. One is to preach to save money. Another is 
                    to state that women doing job is proper. But as the film progressed 
                    to the interval, the bone of contention becomes the woman's 
                    right to do employment. As the second half started, viewers 
                    eagerly waited for comedy than the regular sentimental and 
                    emotional stuff. <br/>
<br/>
                    In a way, this film is very good one if you prefer watching 
                    a pure comedy. But if you prefer a story oriented film, this 
                    film might fail deliver the goods! But for Brahmanandam and 
                    Kovai Sarala this film stands as another feather in their 
                    cap. <br/>
<br/>
                    This Film may fall into the category of 'Premaku Velayara', 
                    whose success lies in heavy promotion of cinema. And Editor 
                    Mohan is just doing it!.</font></p>
