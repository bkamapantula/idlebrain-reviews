                          Professor Tagore (Chiranjeevi) takes up the mission 
                          of eradicating corruption in unlawful society by unlawful 
                          means. He creates ACF (Anti Corruption Force) with a 
                          gang of his ex students. He selects 15 corrupt officers 
                          from each department and kills the most corrupted one 
                          so that others would fear the death and do their job 
                          with honesty. Likewise he kidnaps MROs (mandal Revenue 
                          Officers), SPs (superintendents of police) etc and kills 
                          the top corrupted ones. The police is on the prowl to 
                          identify the mysterious killer. In the meantime, he 
                          exposes the hospital authorities greediness by taking 
                          a corpse there. He makes those greedy corrupt doctors 
                          (who pretend that the patient is alive) operate the 
                          corpse. He there by exposes the system. A police driver 
                          Suryam (Prakash Raj) makes an independent enquiry and 
                          gets all the clues that lead to the killer under cover, 
                          Tagore that is. The film is all about how Tagore created 
                          awareness among the public about corruption and how 
                          he became the most adulated demigod in the state with 
                          his noble mission.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#0000FF">Artists 
                          Performance</font></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chiranjeevi</b>: 
                          Chiranjeevi is at his best, be it in histrionics or 
                          looks. The performance of Chiru in emotional scenes 
                          (when his wife dies and when his ACF members die) is 
                          awesome. He is looking very glamorous in this film and 
                          last time when we saw Chiranjeevi so glamorous was in 
                          the film 'Master'. His dialogue delivery in this film 
                          is very controlled one, yet very effective. The comedy 
                          mannerism in the flashback is also interesting. It goes 
                          without saying that he is best, as always, in dances 
                          and fights.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Heroines</b>: 
                          Shriya played an unimportant role in the film as a girl 
                          who falls for hero. Jyotika is pretty good in her short 
                          role of hero's wife in the flashback. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Others</b>: 
                          Sunil played the role of a cook in hero's house who 
                          feels that heroine is in love with him. His comedy is 
                          OK. But his 'Veena Step' really created laugh riot in 
                          the theater. Prakash Raj played the role of a cop who 
                          is on prowl to uncover the killer. He is apt for the 
                          role. Sayaji Shinde made his debut in Telugu with this 
                          film. He is effective. He dubbed his own voice in Telugu. 
                          Punit Issar played an impressive role in this film like 
                          he did for Indra. K Viswanath did the guest role of 
                          chief minister. VV Vinayak gave a special appearance 
                          as one of the ex students of the hero. The scene involving 
                          him has emotional touch with lots of sentiment attached 
                          to it and he performed it very naturally. He should 
                          consider acting on a big scale in the future. Kota Srinivasa 
                          Rao acted as a top police officer who is pretty lazy. 
                          Actor Jeeva is reduced to set property. The comedy generated 
                          through Narsing Yadav through a couple of fights is 
                          good.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#0000FF">Technical 
                          Departments:</font></b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                          Story:</b> The basic storyline of the film has striking 
                          similarities to Shankar's Genre of social films. There 
                          is one small drawback in the film. The police seems 
                          to be giving protection to the bribe-takers from ACF 
                          instead of sacking tainted officials. That's too when 
                          these officials admit that they took high amount of 
                          money as kickbacks.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay 
                          - direction:</b> VV Vinayak proved his mettle in directing 
                          big stars with this film. His taking is very stylish 
                          and rich. Though he maintained very high standards in 
                          taking, he made sure that the screenplay is gripping 
                          enough to tell a simple story in a powerful way. Vinayak 
                          seems to have mastered the art of narrating climax in 
                          an interesting style with a logical conclusion. He did 
                          perfect characterization to the hero role. He elevated 
                          the hero's greatness through the words uttered by the 
                          people around him. Its definitely the best work till 
                          date by VV Vinayak. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                          Music by Mani Sharma is good. The background music is 
                          excellent. But it dominated some crucial dialogues in 
                          the film. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Songs</b>: 
                          Here is the sequence and description of 6 songs in this 
                          film</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.	
                            Kodithe Kottalira: It's a fast paced set solo song. 
                            The steps performed by Chiranjeevi are slow yet stylish 
                            and graceful. Some of the steps by Chiru were performed 
                            in such a way that one would start wondering if computer 
                            graphics were used.<br/>
<br/>
                            2. Chinnaga Chinnaga: This song is a melody canned 
                            in Polacchi on Chiru and Shriya. Chiru performed slow 
                            steps. This song is good<br/>
<br/>
                            3. Vanochenante: This is a set song on Chiranjeevi 
                            and Shirya with fast steps.<br/>
<br/>
                            4. Gappu Chuppu: This song is another melody pictured 
                            on Jyothika and Chiranjeevi in Ooty.<br/>
<br/>
                            5. Manmadha Manmadha: This is the highlight song of 
                            the film. Chiranjeevi modified Veena step and performed 
                            it in a variety style.<br/>
<br/>
                            6. Nenu Saitham: This is an emotional montage song 
                            that helped the narration of the lead towards climax.<br/>

<b>Dialogues</b>: Paruchuri brothers have done superb

<b>Cinematography</b>: Cinematography by Chota K Naidu

<font color="#0000FF"><b>Analysis</b></font>: The first 
                          15 minutes of the film is simply superlative in the 
                          scenes where titles role as the hero kidnaps the MROs. 
                          This introduction sets the right mood for the rest of 
                          the film to follow. The first half of the film is OK. 
                          The second half is good with interesting episodes. This 
                          film has some political dialogues that were nicely injected 
                          into the film without disturbing the flow. Chiranjeevi 
                          should be commended for choosing film that provides 
                          a social message. Over all this film is a must watch 
                          for everybody. But it's a serious film that has some 
                          heavy stuff in the second half. Don't expect entertainment 
                          in terms of comedy. Due to this fact, the repeat value 
                          of the film might be ruled out for a common mover goer.</font></p>
