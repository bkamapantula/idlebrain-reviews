                          (Siva) is a spoilt brat and is the son of local MP Avataram 
                          (Rajan P Dev). He likes Geeta (Anuradha Mehta) and proposes 
                          her. When she refuses, he threatens that he would jump 
                          from the college top. Being a meek girl, Geeta accepts 
                          the proposal and starts dating him.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arya 
                          (Allu Arjun) is a carefree guy with positive attitude. 
                          He falls in love with Geeta at the first sight. He proposes 
                          her in front of her boyfriend. She bluntly refuses. 
                          The rest of the film is all about how he wins Geeta 
                          with his attitude and positive outlook.</font></p>

<img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-arya3.jpg" width="150"/><b>Allu 
                          Arjun</b>: If you attribute the success of Gangotri 
                          to K Raghavendra Rao and write off Allu Arjun as a hero, 
                          you are in a soup. With his exceptionally great performance 
                          in 'Arya', hero Allu Arjun announces that he is here 
                          to stay and to leave a mark of his own. All those guys 
                          who admire Chiranjeevi's dancing skills would end up 
                          thinking like how great it would have been if Chiranjeevi 
                          ever get someone compose dances like Allu Arjun has 
                          done in 'Takadhinatom' song. Allu Arjun is simply awesome 
                          in dances. He is natural in his histrionics. He is amazing 
                          in stunt sequences. However, he looks like imitating 
                          Pawan Kalyan (of Kushi) in few college scenes. He also 
                          needs to get his dialogues modulated in the right way. 
                          He has a cool dressing sense.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="right" height="100" src="../../images1/small-arya10.jpg" width="150"/><b>Anuradha 
                          Mehta</b>: Anuradha Mehta is OK. She looks good in half 
                          sarees towards the climax of the film. She did well 
                          with in her limits. She has a broader frame and has 
                          certain similarities to Katrina Kaif. Savita's dubbing 
                          has become monotonous these days. They should have tried 
                          a fresh dubbing artist for Anuradha.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-arya4.jpg" width="150"/><b>Others</b>: 
                          Siva is good as adamant, at times confused, lover. He 
                          generated comedy in few scenes where he shows his frustration. 
                          Subbaraju is terrific as henchman to villain. Vidya 
                          is natural and lovable as the friend of heroine. Venu 
                          Madhav and Devi Charan got good footage and generated 
                          neat comedy. Babloo did the roll of hero's buddy. Sunil 
                          did a guest role of a TT called 'Punch Falaknama'. The 
                          kids in the film also have done well.</font></p>

                          - Screenplay - dialogues - direction: </b> Story of 
                          the film is wafer-thin. It is absolutely impossible 
                          to direct a flick with such a frail story line. But 
                          the debutant Sukumar handled this film with terrific 
                          characterizations and an extraordinary screenplay. The 
                          director Sukumar has exhibited great sensibility while 
                          executing few shots in the film. He fails you to guess 
                          the next scene most of the times. I do often wonder 
                          while looking at a few Tamil films that why our Telugu 
                          directors cannot execute such creative shots. Here is 
                          an answer in the form of Sukumar. Dialogues by Sukumar 
                          are apt and are sprinkled with sensible humor. Simple 
                          and effective like 'Repu morning - Arya ki warning'! 
                          Here are few scenes that leave a lasting impression 
                          -</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.	
                            The heroine asks Arya in the beginning of the film: 
                            'Enduku extralu chestunnav'<br/>
                            The same heroine says to Arya in the climax: Kasepu 
                            nenu Arya laga, nuvvu nenu laaga anukundama?' That 
                            is the beauty of Arya's characterization. In the beginning 
                            of the film, you end up thinking why hero is doing 
                            extras. And as the film progresses, you fall in love 
                            with that character.<br/>
<br/>
                            2. The love letter written by Arya. The following 
                            scene of girls reading it out in a classical song 
                            mode. The subsequent hate letter to the heroine's 
                            friend.<br/>
<br/>
                            3. The scene in which Arya cracks his whip up on surroundings 
                            of baddies instead of attacking them in order to show 
                            what he is capable of doing.<br/>
<br/>
                            4. The birthday gift Arya gives to Geeta. <br/>
<br/>
                            5. The driving scene where Arya shows variation in 
                            the pitch of his voice as per the visibility of Geeta 
                            in the mirror.<br/>
<br/>
                            6. The scene in which Arya leads Siva and Geeta to 
                            railway station and coolly says - 'vallu vaste appudu 
                            parigette badulu. Mundu parigetti vallaku chikkakunda 
                            vundadam manchidi kada'.<br/>
<br/>
                            7. The entire thread of Arya trying to score goal 
                            by putting a stone into a cup placed at a distance.<br/>
<br/>
                            8. The scene in which they do the role play and she 
                            proposes to Arya that she loves him. And the subsequent 
                            scene where Geeta leaves crying. (Actually the director 
                            has shown it effectively how other people get hurt 
                            when you refuse the proposal).<br/>
<br/>
                            9. The scene in which the kids come up with a farewell 
                            gift to Geeta.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-arya8.jpg" width="150"/><b>Music</b>: 
                          Music by Devi Sri Prasad is extraordinary. Be it songs 
                          or background score. Devi Sri Prasad has exhibited his 
                          command over all departments of music and came up with 
                          a complete musical. It is nice to see Devi Sri Prasad 
                          reaching great heights at a young age. His music is 
                          full of energy and verve. Here is the description of 
                          six songs as per the order in the film</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. 
                            <b>Takadhimithom</b>: It is the introduction song 
                            for hero. Allu Arjun proves that he is the best among 
                            the youth heroes when it comes to dancing. He has 
                            got grace. He is at home as he makes the most difficult 
                            steps appear casually done on the screen. Choreographer 
                            Harish Pai came up with some awesome stuff.<br/>
<br/>
                            2. <b>Feel My Love</b>: It is a melody song picturized 
                            on hero about how much he loves heroine. It is a montage 
                            song. Nixon choreographed this song. There is so much 
                            of rhythm in the body language of Allu Arjun. He improvised 
                            few steps of Michael Jackson and performed with a 
                            great Ã©lan. Chandra Bose's lyrics for this 
                            song depict the exact state of mind of Arya.<br/>
<br/>
                            3. <b>You Rock My World</b>: This is the song before 
                            interval. It's a pub song where Allu Arjun breaks 
                            into song to entertain crowds. Raju Sundaram has done 
                            a fantastic job for this song. It's a hip and happening 
                            song.<br/>
<br/>
                            4. <b>Oh My brotheru</b>: It's an entertaining situational 
                            song where hero expresses the luxuries and comforts 
                            of being a one-sided lover. There is so much of philosophical 
                            (with simple words) meaning in the lyrics of Sirivennela. 
                            Ashok choreographed for this cool song.<br/>
<br/>
                            5. <b>Aa ante Amalapuram</b>: This is the fifth song 
                            in the film. It's a complete mass item number picturized 
                            atop of a moving train (like Chayya Chayya of Dil 
                            Se film) on Allu Arjun and Abhinaya Sri. Shankar choreographed 
                            it. It falls little short of what we expect after 
                            listening to the song in audio player.<br/>
<br/>
                            6. <b>Nuvvante</b>: This is the best song in the film 
                            as far as the content is concerned. It's situational 
                            song which provides some privacy to Arya and Geeta 
                            so that they can explore the feelings of each other.</font></p>

                          The photography by Ratnavelu is amazing. The first shot 
                          of the film itself shows the class of this new cinematographer. 
                          You find the visual richness that can only be found 
                          in the films that are directed by Mani Ratnam. Ratnavelu 
                          is extremely creative, immensely talented and has got 
                          a great future ahead.</font></p>

                          departments</b>: Stunts by Ram Lakshman are very powerful. 
                          The fights are measured ones, efficient and are very 
                          believable. Editing by Marthand K Venkatesh is crisp. 
                          I liked the editing cuts during the titles part a lot. 
                          Art work is trendy. Locations chosen are rare and they 
                          ooze freshness. Production values of this film are lavish. 
                          Producer Raju should be commended for selecting such 
                          a sensible storyline and employing the perfect cast

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1.	
                            The crucial dialogue of Nuvvu Kavali (Naaku vaadikanna 
                            mundu I Love You enduku cheppaledu) is re-used in 
                            this film for a vital scene as it is.<br/>
<br/>
                            2. The climax of the film is a typical Trivikramish 
                            one. Hero - being a too good to believe guy - doing 
                            arrangements at the heroines marriage ala Nuvvu Naaku 
                            Nachav.</font></font></p>

                          First half of the film is full of fun. The second half 
                          is good. The last half an hour of the film (especially 
                          after the last song) is great. You feel like you are 
                          watching a Mani Rathnam film. Thanks to majestic visuals 
                          (Rathnevelu - cinematographer), splendid music (Devi 
                          Sri Prasad - music director) and marvelous framing (Sukumar 
                          - director)! There is a soul in the film and you end 
                          up having a thin layer of tears in your eyes while leaving 
                          the theater. This film announces the arrival of Sukumar 
                          - director - a class apart. 'Arya' is a must watch film 
                          for all Telugu film lovers. Don't miss it!!</font></p>

                          Talk</b>: This film has generated unanimous super hit 
                          talk all over. This film was bought for 42 lakhs for 
                          Krishna territory. If we add the cost of print and publicity 
                          it would go up to 50 lakhs. This film is expected to 
                          amass a share of 80 lakhs to 1 crores in long run in 
                          Krishna territory. The range of success of 'Arya' would 
                          depend on how other films fare relatively in this summer 
                          season. This film has got typical urban look. Hence 
                          it may find less success in B and C centers. </font></p>
