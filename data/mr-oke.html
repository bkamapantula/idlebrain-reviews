<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Purushottam 
                    (Arjun) is a handsome, both mentally and physically, cameraman 
                    at Qtv. Chowdary (Raghuvaran) is the CM of the state. He believes 
                    that his CM chair has four legs (namely money lenders, caste, 
                    gross root workers of the party and students). In order to 
                    pacify all these groups, he has to make lots of compromises 
                    in his administration. There by his indecisiveness leads to 
                    riots and discontent among the people. <br/>
<br/>
                    Purushottam spots the village belle Chandramukhi (Manisha 
                    Koirala) and duly falls in love with her. But father of the 
                    Chandramukhi wants his daughter to marry a govt. employee 
                    than a TV cameraman. <br/>
<br/>
                    As he is a cameraman, Purushottam cans all these riots and 
                    rescues the people. As Purushottam report on the riots become 
                    popular, he is given promotion as a senior reporter. And his 
                    first assignment turns out to be an interview with the CM 
                    of the state, Chowdary. <br/>
<br/>
                    In that spirited interview Purushottam questions the CM's 
                    non-transparent functionality. When CM refutes back that Purushottam 
                    is misusing media to malign him, Purushottam shows all the 
                    evidence. A piqued CM he is, Chowdary challenges Purushottam 
                    to act as CM for a day. Only then one can understand the immense 
                    pressure of being CM. After much deliberation Purushottam 
                    accepts the offer. Chowdary passes an ordinance to make Purushottam 
                    CM for a day by giving his resignation letter and the letter 
                    of support by his MLA's. <br/>
<br/>
                    Purushottam starts his day as CM with having a meeting with 
                    civil servants (IAS and IPS). He instructs all the officers 
                    to dig out all the files on corrupt officials and he duly 
                    suspends all of them on the spot. He gives surprise inspections 
                    to various places (slums, ration shops etc.) and solves the 
                    problems instantly. He organizes a live tele conference with 
                    the people of state and solve their problems on the spot. 
                    By the end of the he makes the 12 ministers of Chowdary get 
                    arrested. The icing on the cake turn out to be the arrest 
                    of Chowdary itself at the dusk of the day. As the media covers 
                    all the movements of Purushottam and broadcasts live on all 
                    the channels, Purushottam becomes the icon of god governance 
                    and a ray of hope to the people. Incidentally Chowdary's decision 
                    to play the ball into Purushottam's hand turns out to be a 
                    blunder and the closure of Chowdary's political career. <br/>
<br/>
                    After Chowdary resumes power as CM, he gets dumped as a no-confidence 
                    motion is passed. Fresh elections are announced. Muddu Krishna 
                    (Manivannan) is a secretary to CM. He plays a vital role in 
                    bringing Purushottam, who otherwise is reluctant, into the 
                    active politics by making him realize the importance of being 
                    a constructive politician. Purushottam's party wins all the 
                    seats in the state. <br/>
<br/>
                    After getting elected Purushottam implements innovative ideas. 
                    Chowdary and other leaders start cooking up ideas to assassinate 
                    Purushottam. If you wanna know how Purushottam wins over evil 
                    minded Chowdary and marries his village belle Chandramukhi, 
                    you must watch this fill in tinsel screen with good sound 
                    equipment. </font></p>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Actors:</b>
<br/>
<b><br/>
                  Arjun: </b>He lives up to his title 'Action King' in this film. 
                  His role needs to show lot of brain than brawn. He stole the 
                  show with his right expressions. Even at this age he maintains 
                  a body that is near to six pack. <br/>
<b> Manisha:</b> Manisha is looking contrastingly different 
                  from her earlier films. She epitomizes the innocence of a village 
                  belle. Some people may not like her facial expressions in the 
                  first half as they are very raw, yet sensual. But Manisha is 
                  a treat to watch in songs. <br/>
<b> Manivannan:</b> Manivannan seems to be penetrating into 
                  the hearts of telugu viewers off late. His character, dubbed 
                  by Kota, looks very powerful and has a bit of comedy attached 
                  to it. <br/>
<b> Laila:</b> She is given an insignificant role for which 
                  she did full justice. <br/>
<b> Sushmita Sen:</b> She acted in a special song. She looks 
                  very sensual in this song unlike her other songs. <br/>
<b><br/>
                  Screenplay:</b> Slickness and Deftness are the two words that 
                  best describes it. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Direction:</b> Shankar emerged as a film maker of social 
                  responsibility time and again. He tried his best to evoke the 
                  mass consciousness among the viewers about their social life. 
                  He deftly woven the love story between Chandramukhi and Purushottam 
                  and shown it as a backdrop to the political making of Purushottam 
                  and undoing of Chowdary. One particular shot makes us realize 
                  the power of Shankar. When Purushottam is reluctant to enter 
                  the politics after his stint as a one day CM, Muddu Krishna 
                  takes him out of his house and shows him the thousands of people 
                  harboring out side his house to see Purushottam accept the political 
                  entry. (The same technique is used in 'Iddaru' by Maniratnam, 
                  when Prakash raj shows Mohanlal the power of public adulation 
                  by showing the public who are going crazy over him) <br/>
<br/>
<b> Photography:</b> Anand, a relatively new name in the circles 
                  of photography, attained a new peak in popularity with this 
                  film. Cinematography in this film is a treat to your eyes. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Music:</b> A R Rehman needs to introduction. He did full 
                  justice to his job. Music for songs and backdrop score is excellent. 
                  <br/>
<br/>
<b> Production:</b> Richness and quality are the catch words 
                  for this film's production. <br/>

                  Song One: Shakalaka Baby:</b> This song is about Arjun doing 
                  a video shoot for a song. Sushmita Sen looks ravishing in this 
                  song and there is absolutely no vulgarity in the naughty thing 
                  Sush do in this song. It is shot in the genre of MTv and Channel 
                  V. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Song Two: Andala Rakshasive:</b> This song is so natural. 
                  Highlight of this song is making the best use of group dancers 
                  by making them appear like pots, corns, sun flowers, Kondapalli 
                  bommalu, Disti Bommalu. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Song Three: 'Nelloru Nerajana':</b> Its a melodious song 
                  with slow steps. This song starts with a dance at a waterfall 
                  during dawn and ends with dancing at a burning hills during 
                  the dusk. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Song Four: 'Maga Dheera':</b> This song is total graphical 
                  song. This song is a theme song that reflects the moods of the 
                  second half of the film. Dr K R Narayanan, President of India, 
                  seems to have stopped and had a comprehensive look at the shooting 
                  of this song in New Delhi and seems to have immensely enjoyed 
                  it. Superb song it is. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Song Five: 'Utti Meeda Koodu':</b> This song is the latest 
                  folk sensation on the block. Sensible steps and sexy music makes 
                  this song an instant hit and perfect song to lead for the climax. 
                  You get a tinge of 'Mudinepalli' song of Gentleman. </font></td>

                  needs to be given a special applause for taking such a burning 
                  and relevant topic of social life and adapting it to the theme 
                  of cinema and directing it with such a skill without losing 
                  the commercial touch and glamour of the film. Though there are 
                  lot of other people who gets the credit for this fabulous work, 
                  the hands down winner is going to be one and only Shankar. His 
                  character of CM closely resembles the working style of Chandrababu 
                  Naidu. May be the vision of Shankar's ideal CM suits with the 
                  functionality of Chandra Babu Naidu. It is a welcoming change 
                  to get such film which educate people and create awareness among 
                  them about good transparent governance. People who make films 
                  like 'Pichivadi Chetilo Raayi' must take a leaf out of Shankar's 
                  page to emulate him. Everybody who comes out of theaters gets 
                  a feeling that they watched a film that is worth making impact 
                  on their thinking process. </font></td>
