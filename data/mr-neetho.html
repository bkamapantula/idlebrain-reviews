<br/>
                    Madhav (Surya Prakash) is an orphan and a new entrant into 
                    a local college in Hyderabad. He spots the college beauty 
                    Shalini and falls in love with her at the first sight. Madhav 
                    is a levelheaded guy with cool attitude where as Shalini is 
                    a short-tempered lady. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She 
                    indulges in a fight with an eve teaser and thrashes him with 
                    a soft drink bottle. Father of that eve teaser turns out to 
                    be a faction leader in that area. When Madhav goes to that 
                    faction leader to teach him a lesson, it is revealed that 
                    Madhav is none but the son of Manohar (Prakash Raj), the richest 
                    and most successful Industrial tycoon of the country. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                    the flash back it is shown that Manohar arranges a 'swayamvaram' 
                    kind of thing for Mahdav to select a bride for himself. Madhav 
                    feels that all the girls who have come there want to marry 
                    him because he is the son of a billionaire. He wants a girl 
                    to love him for what he is but not for his money. Hence, he 
                    requests his dad to leave him for a year so that he joins 
                    in a college in Hyderabad as a normal student and selects 
                    a girl who loves him for what he is. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
                    none of his friends including Shalini, know the background 
                    of Madhav. Shalini rejects Madhav outrightly when he proposes 
                    to her. She says that she is grateful to Madhav for his help 
                    in getting rid of the eve teaser harassment and that it does 
                    not mean that she should love him. Then Madhav asks her to 
                    act as his lover for 30 days and he hints that she would automatically 
                    fall in love. Shalini accepts the offer and starts acting 
                    as his lover for 30 days.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    the period of 30 days, Shalini tells Madhav that she is not 
                    in love with him. But in her heart, she has love towards him. 
                    But she suppresses her heart with her preconceived notion 
                    of not falling in love.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    a lot of rethinking and consulting with her parents, she decides 
                    to express her love to Madhav. But by then, she comes to know 
                    that Madhav is the son of a billionaire. She thinks that he 
                    might feel that she came back to him after realizing that 
                    he is the heir of a business tycoon. Would these lovers unite 
                    or not is the point that is dealt in climax.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists</b>: 
                    </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Surya 
                    Prakash</b>: The USP of this film is Surya Prakash with the 
                    tag of 'Son of K Raghavendra Rao'. He looked quite awkward 
                    in the posters of the film, which gave kind of negative impression. 
                    But, when you watch him on the big screen, he looks pretty 
                    decent though he looks more matured than his age with thick 
                    eyebrows and broad forehead. Acting wise, he is good. His 
                    dialogue delivery needs some modulation and variation. It's 
                    too monotonous. But, he suited the character to the tee and 
                    did justice to the role given to him by portraying fine expressions. 
                    </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mehek</b>: 
                    She is probably the most lissome heroine after Sonali Bendre 
                    in Telugu films. She did well. She is extremely good at dancing. 
                    She can move her body in any direction in a split of moment 
                    with the ease of a classical dancer. She also puts fine expressions 
                    on her face according to mood of the song while dancing.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other 
                    actors</b>: Sunil is definitely the scene-stealer of the film 
                    with his comedy. Rajiv Kanakala did the role of <i>bakra</i> 
                    who is cheated by Sunil for petty money and gifts. This comedy 
                    is nicely intervened with the main storyline. Prakash Raj 
                    did his typical over-protective father kind of role in this 
                    film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                    Story</b>: Dale Carnegie wrote in a book titled 'How to win 
                    friends and influence people' that 'if you want to become 
                    somebody  just act as if you are already in that position 
                     then you can achieve anything'. In this film too when 
                    the heroine starts acting as a lover, she really falls in 
                    love. The basic storyline of the film is very good.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay 
                    - Direction</b>: Screenplay and treatment is fresh in the 
                    first half. But the director lost grip of the proceedings 
                    in the second half. John has got good creativity and freshness 
                    in the direction and taking of shots. But the authority over 
                    narrating the story interestingly is missing. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Dialogues by Viswanath are apt for the scenes. He has good 
                    grip on comedy dialogues as well.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music:</b> 
                    Another best asset of the film is excellent tunes. Though 
                    three of the songs have inspired music, Vidya Sagar made sure 
                    that each song is a gem. And they are knitted well into the 
                    film as situational songs. Background score is also very impressive. 
                    This film might mark the return of Telugu music director Vidya 
                    Sagar back into Tollywood.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    The main asset of the film is excellent photography by Chota 
                    K Naidu. Each and every frame of the film is picturesquely 
                    canned. Excellent locations added the necessary glitter to 
                    the silver screen.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    First half of the film is promising. But the second half takes 
                    a severe beating with dragged scenes and snail-paced narration. 
                    This film is an average to below-average fare for class audiences. 
                    But masses might not like it. This film launches Surya Prakash 
                    as a promising hero. The director succeeded in giving Surya 
                    Prakash a few scenes that can give scope for a hero to do 
                    different kinds of histrionics. Usha Kiran movies has the 
                    most promising advertising media it its hand in the form of 
                    'E TV'. We have to wait and see if that publicity changes 
                    the fortunes of this otherwise ordinary film.</font></p>
