                          (Ravi Krishna) is a teenager staying with his parents 
                          in Brindavan Colony, Hyderabad. He is the perfect example 
                          of how any parents would not want their son to be like. 
                          He is bad at studies, ill-disciplined, good at irritating 
                          the neighbors. He has a listless gang that consists 
                          of fellow irksome teenage students from his neighborhood.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="right" height="100" src="../../images1/small-7gbc4.jpg" width="150"/>One 
                          fine day, a beautiful Punjabi girl by name Anita (Sonia 
                          Agarwal) joins Ravi's neighborhood in 7/G numbered flat. 
                          She steals his heart at first sight. Ravi falls for 
                          her immediately. But he is too shabby, uneducated and 
                          low for the tastes and standards of Anita. Moreover, 
                          she has a rich Punjabi boyfriend who also financially 
                          supports his father's business. But this does not deter 
                          the determination of Ravi loving Anita. He follows her, 
                          teases her and irritates her. In one such situation, 
                          she even slaps him with her sandals.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-7gbc2.jpg" width="150"/>Stuck 
                          with the hard reality, Ravi stops following Anita. And 
                          Anita starts observing Ravi and she slowly realizes 
                          how good Ravi is at heart and how materialistic her 
                          boyfriend is. But by then her marriage is already fixed. 
                          She wants to break the convention and want to make Ravi 
                          a socially-respectable guy. She realizes that he is 
                          very good at assembling parts of motorbikes and motivates 
                          him to obtain a job at Hero Honda. In the process, they 
                          fall in love. When everything is going smooth, Anita's 
                          mother realizes about Anita-Ravi affair and breaks their 
                          communication.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="right" height="100" src="../../images1/small-7gbc1.jpg" width="150"/>However, 
                          they manage to get to meet each other on the eve of 
                          a friend's wedding. They stay in the same room of the 
                          hotel. Anita has a problem. Her father is a heart patient 
                          who believes that she is a good obedient daughter, whereas 
                          she falls in love with a guy, against his wish. She 
                          is very concerned about her ailing father, but at the 
                          same time could not evade her love for Ravi. She makes 
                          a decision. That is to give her lover, a one night sexual 
                          pleasure. However, the next day a gruesome incident 
                          happens. Police are in search for Ravi? Would they arrest 
                          Ravi for this? Would Anita's father suffer his impending 
                          3rd heart attack? You should watch this true life story 
                          yourself to know about it!</font></p>

                          Krishna</b>: Casting the right person for the right 
                          role brings accolades not only to the actor (histrionics) 
                          but also to the director (characterization). The trade 
                          secret of success of any artist lies in the kind of 
                          character he/she choose play as per his/her strengths, 
                          looks and body language. And Ravi Krishna is the best 
                          actor to play the role of Ravi in this film. He did 
                          so well that people would think if he grew up in those 
                          kinds of flats and that kind of psychology. It is an 
                          author-backed role. And Ravi Krishna did it with great 
                          poise. He is not good in looks department. He is not 
                          good at dances as well. But suited the character and 
                          that's what matters. His dialogue delivery, though has 
                          some Chennai-bred Telugu boy's accent, is decent.</font></p>

                          - screenplay - direction</b>: Story of the film is realistic. 
                          It is also said to be based on true story. Direction 
                          of the film is sensible. Screenplay is slick. The characterization 
                          of Ravi and Anita is simply terrific. The narration 
                          is bit slower. It needs guts and commitment to have 
                          tragic climax in films. Kudos to Sri Raghava for his 
                          bold attempt! However, the director went overboard in 
                          certain scenes by making the vulgarity to creep in (though 
                          most of those scenes replicas of are real-world incidents). 
                          The director Sri Raghava (known as Selva Raghavan in 
                          Tamil) has the element of sex in all his films - be 
                          it Tulluvatho Illamai (Juniors in Telugu), Kadhal Konden 
                          (Nenu in Telugu) or 7/G Brindavan Colony. This film 
                          also shows a scene involving premarital sex (initiated 
                          by the girl). But the credit of making this scene not 
                          an obscene one goes to the director himself. Here are 
                          few episodes that were brilliantly executed by the director</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Emotional 
                          moments:</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. The scene 
                            in which Ravi meets Anita for the first time on the 
                            terrace of the apartment. (Post slapping-with-sandal-episode).<br/>
<br/>
                            2. The interval block scene in which Ravi explodes 
                            and tells his heart's content in a very understanding 
                            manner to Anita.<br/>
<br/>
                            3. The song (1st song in 2nd half) which consolidates 
                            the budding love feelings of Anita towards Ravi.<br/>
<br/>
                            4. The scene in which Ravi's father (Chandra Mohan) 
                            secretly repents for scolding his son all the while 
                            after seeing the employment letter from Hero Honda.<br/>
<br/>
                            5. Ravi scarifying his reputation by lying to police 
                            that he forcibly took Anita away. (to save Anita's

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-7gbc10.jpg" width="150"/><b>Music</b>: 
                          The biggest plus point of the film apart from screenplay 
                          and direction is the background music by Yuan Shankar 
                          Raja (son of Maestro Ilayaraja). The background music 
                          rendered for this film is the best in recent years. 
                          And it reminds us of the standard of the background 
                          music scored by Ilayaraja for Geetanjali film. The songs 
                          scored are also good, but were not used in the film 
                          effectively enough. 'Thalachi thalachi chooste' is the 
                          best song in terms of melody, content and situational 
                          strength.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="right" height="100" src="../../images1/small-7gbc9.jpg" width="150"/><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                          Dialogues by AM Ratnam are colloquial. The pre-interval 
                          dialogue is pretty good. There is lots of response from 
                          crowds for the bit - Aiswarya Rai ante andariki istame. 
                          Kaani andariki Aiswarya dorakadu. Andukani pelli kaani 
                          abbailu vere ammailani preminchadamledaa. Pelli aina 
                          vallu pellalatho samsaram cheyyadam leda?' (A dialogue 
                          that reinforces the willingness of Ravi to befriend 
                          Anita though she is getting married to another guy).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other departments</b>: 
                          Photography by Aravind Krishna is good. Artwork is authentic. 
                          Editing by GG Krishna Rao is adequate. Stunts by Peter 
                          Hyne are satisfactory. Production values of prestigious 
                          banner Sri Surya Movies are excellent. </font></p>

                          film is devoted for youth entertainment about how boy 
                          gets desperate with the girl. The emotion catches up 
                          from the moment boy is slapped by the girl. The interval 
                          block is great and the climax is very impressive. This 
                          film starts with light-hearted entertainment and ends 
                          up with heavy emotions. This film showcases the scene-weaving 
                          abilities (screenplay) of Sri Raghava who narrated the 
                          first two hours of film with a mundane subject. Doing 
                          a tragic climax and making it commercially acceptable 
                          is one hell of a task. And Sri Raghava succeeded in 
                          it. This film would become a good hit and the acceptance 
                          of tragic climax by the masses would determine the range 
                          of this film. I would add this film to the dare-to-be-different 
                          genre of commercially successful love stories released 
                          this year - Arya and Anand. You must watch it!</font></p>
