<br/>
                    Abhiram (Nagarjuna) is a manager in his own ad agency. He 
                    hates women and he feels that all women are traitors. Abhiram's 
                    uncle (Tanikella Bharani), who is the chairman of the ad agency, 
                    appoints Harika (Sonali Bendre) as an assistant manager. Though 
                    Abhiram does not like a girl joining his company, he has to 
                    live with it as the appointment is made by his uncle (Tanikella 
                    Bharani). He starts mistreating her. Harika, vexed by Abhiram's 
                    acts, submits her resignation to Abhi's uncle, who then narrates 
                    the flashback of Abhiram to Harika.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Abhi 
                    is born with a golden spoon. Abhi is raised by his grandfather 
                    (Balayya) as his parents die soon after the birth of Abhi. 
                    Abhi falls in love with Maheswari (Anshu), who is the niece 
                    of an employee (Chandra Mohan) in Abhi's grandfather's company. 
                    Alarmed by this, Chandra Mohan takes her away to his home 
                    town and arranges pelli choopulu with another guy. Abhi travels 
                    all the way to the venue and takes Maheswari away. While traveling 
                    back, they met with an accident. After 10 days, when Abhi 
                    comes out of coma, he is told that Maheswari is about to marry 
                    some other guy. Shocked by this news, Abhi develops hatred 
                    towards women.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    narrating the flashback, Abhi's uncle promotes Harika to Manager 
                    position and demotes Abhi to Assistant Manager position. The 
                    rest of the story is all about how Abhi falls in love with 
                    Harika.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists</b>:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nagarjuna</b>: 
                    Nagarjuna is extremely gorgeous in this film. He looks very 
                    elegant in those business outfits. He looks strikingly attractive 
                    and youthful in the flashback episode. The costumes for the 
                    flashback episode for Nagarjuna are of two types. One type 
                    is the khaadi/silk kind of <a href="../../images/wp-8manmadhuduthumb.jpg">modern 
                    shirts</a> on jeans. The other type is the ones he used to 
                    wear for films like Shiva. Nagarjuna has gone a step ahead 
                    in terms of handling comedy scenes. His body language, gestures, 
                    mannerisms are very well utilized to generate comedy. Nagarjuna 
                    single-handedly generated comedy in first half. Brahmanandam 
                    and Sunil come in second half for a few scenes. He did extremely 
                    well in a couple of pathos scenes as well. This charmer of 
                    Charminar mesmerizes you with his enchanting presence on the 
                    screen.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sonali 
                    Bendre</b>: Sonali Bendre is pretty good and she is a perfect 
                    match for Nagarjuna in terms of screen presence. She exhibited 
                    her ease in doing the role of a working woman. Her histrionics 
                    are just perfect. Sunitha's dubbing suited her.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Anshu</b>: 
                    The London based NRI girl looks OK. But director's tender 
                    characterization for her role takes her performance to new 
                    heights. There is innocence in her character and she suited 
                    well to that role. The voice dubbed for her role is very much 
                    similar to that of Laya's voice and its very apt.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other 
                    Cast</b>: Tanikella Bharani has got an excellent character 
                    of a supporting uncle in this film. He exhibited a fine balance 
                    in voice modulation and emotions. Brahmanandam did a cameo 
                    role of 'Lavanga' (a French NRI). The episodes featuring him 
                    and Nag together are extremely hilarious. Sunil has done another 
                    wonderful character. He acted as 'Banku Seenu' and his serious 
                    gestures and underplayed dialogue delivery makes us laugh 
                    our heart out. Chandra Mohan donned the role of a loyal manager. 
                    Dharmavarapu Subramanyan played another hilarious 3-scene 
                    role in this film as a seller of secret-mike devices. All 
                    artists in the film are utilized for generating optimal output.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                    Story</b>: Its a typical Trivikram story i.e. heroine falls 
                    in with hero only after her engagement is completed. Another 
                    striking similarity in Trivikram's stories is that all the 
                    climaxes involve the hero getting heroine back when she is 
                    getting married to another guy. The story has ANR trademark 
                    in it. (ANR is shown as playboy in films who later falls in 
                    love with a single girl)</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay 
                    - Direction</b>: The hallmark in Vijaya Bhaskar's direction 
                    is completeness and sensibility. He is as good as Yash Chopra 
                    for handling sensible films involving human relations glorifying 
                    cinematic grammar. The way he portrays Teluguness in characterizations 
                    makes you feel that the story is happening in your home/neighborhood. 
                    Vijaya Bhaskar proved his mettle again with 'Manmadhudu'.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Trivikram infused life and abundant comedy into film with 
                    his witty dialogues. At the same time, there are gems of dialogues 
                    that tell you the facts of life. He knows how to play with 
                    the words and he writes repartee dialogues with nice rhyme.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                    Music by Devi Sri Prasad is excellent. Even the background 
                    score is pretty good. The picturization of the songs have 
                    elevated the audio of Manmadhudu.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Costumes</b>: 
                    Costimes by Asmita (<a href="../../images/newpg-100days-santosham10.jpg">photo</a>) 
                    for Nagarjuna are awesome. She has also provided costumes 
                    for Nagarjuna in 'Santosham'.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Songs:</b> 
                    Songs in this film come in the following order</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. 
                      <a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.teluguzine.com/audio/manmadhudu1.html','Mrugaraju','width=200,height=280')">Dont 
                      Marry</a>: This song comes at a marriage function. Nagarjuna 
                      attends the marriage of his employee and exposes the perils 
                      of getting married. It's a group song with Nagarjuna being 
                      the center of attraction. A highlight in this song is when 
                      nag talks about his old friend 'shiva', Nagarjuna appears 
                      in Shiva getup with a cycle chain and acts in a skit with 
                      Rekha (Anandam fame) as his wife. He again appears in the 
                      combination of Keerti Chawla (Aadi fame) when he says 'aa 
                      malli gadu'. Overall it's an exciting song that preaches 
                      the philosophy behind Nag's hatred for women.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2.

                      hero in the flashback. Nagarjuna expresses his tender feelings 
                      of love for Anshu at this party. Nag teases Anshu in his 
                      demure style. Anshu is lovely in this song as a girl smitten 
                      by love bug.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3.

                      Emundo</a>: This song comes when Nag invites Anshu for a 
                      midnight meet. This song is shot in the lush greenery of 
                      France. A slow song with stylish steps.(<a href="../../images/newpg-manmadhudu20.jpg">photo</a>)</font></p>

                      Bhamalu</a>: This is the best song of the film when it comes 
                      to the kind of whistles it got from frontbenchers. This 
                      song is placed at an apt situation. This song comes when 
                      Nagarjuna is upset with Sonali. He wants to show his indifference 
                      to Sonali by dancing with other damsels in his office.(<a href="../../images/newpg-manmadhudu34.jpg">photo</a>)</font></p>

                      Chelia</a>: This song comes as a lead to climax. This song 
                      has two different things twined. One is about hero traveling 
                      to heroine's marriage venue by using all kind of vehicles 
                      (ranging from a posh car to a bullock cart). The other one 
                      is a romantic fast dance between Nagarjuna and Sonali dressed 
                      in black.(<a href="../../images/newpg-manmadhudu24.jpg">photo</a>)</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    Photography of Sameer Reddy is excellent. And credit goes 
                    to him for showing Nagarjuna extra-glamorous. The lighting 
                    in this film is very consistent.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production:</b> 
                    The return of Annapurna Studios in to film production turned 
                    out to be a successful one. The total credit goes to Nagarjuna 
                    Akkineni for hiring the right people and selecting the right 
                    script.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    <br/>
                    First half of the film is extremely entertaining (total comedy 
                    + flashback romance). And second half (comedy + story) is 
                    better than first half. If I had to write anything disturbing 
                    about this film, there is only one point. The climax of the 
                    film is shown in a very simple way with a single Sunil dialogue 
                    on cell phone <i>'Nanna! Nenu Banku. Pellikuthuru Jumpu</i>'. 
                    People, expecting a prolonged climax might find this one to 
                    be an abrupt one. Other than this single remark, the entire 
                    film is excellent. 95% of the scenes in the film are comedy 
                    dialogues. There are few sentiment scenes. But these very 
                    few sentiment scenes are bound to leave impact on you. Nagarjuna 
                    dominated the show and won accolades from audiences. It's 
                    a must recommended hilarious film for all Telugu film lovers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Comparison</b>: 
                    When director and hero have latest hits behind their back, 
                    the comparison is inevitable. This film is definitely better 
                    than Santosham (Nagarjuna's earlier film). Manmadhudu is as 
                    good as Nuvvu Naaku Nachav (Vijaya Bhaskar's earlier film).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Trade 
                    Talk</b>: This film has got hit talk from the word 'go'. Classes 
                    and female audiences would love this film. But we have to 
                    wait and see how masses from B and C centers receive it.</font></p>
