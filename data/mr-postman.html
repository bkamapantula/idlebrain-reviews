<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vishnu(Mohan 
              Babu) is a postman in Hyderabad. He is the caring guy around and 
              everybody loves him, naturally. He has a maternal uncle called Ramkoti(Kota), 
              who occupied Vishnu's ancestral house after the death of Vishnu's 
              parents. Vishnu Stays in a pathetic structure that is built on the 
              top of Ramakoti's house. Ramakoti has a beautiful daughter called 
              Sirisha(Raasi). Sirisha adulates Vishnu and wants in marry him. 
              <br/>
<br/>
              Postman is rather a curious guy. He would be boozing every night. 
              And reading the letters of others and accordingly deliver them in 
              such a way that it will help the receiver. Whenever Sirisha expresses 
              her wish to marry him, Vishnu gives an elusive reply that he has 
              a dream girl and he will marry her. <br/>
<br/>
              One fine morning Vishnu brings a beautiful girl to his house. She 
              is Archana(Soundarya). He introduces Archana to everybody and reveals 
              that she is his fiancee. Ramakoti wants Vishnu to marry his daughter. 
              After a bit of research he comes to know that Archana is just released 
              from a jail. When confronted Vishnu admits that Archana was jailed.<br/>
<br/>
              *interval*<br/>
<br/>
              Vishnu elaborates his relationship with Archana. Archana is an inmate 
              of an Orphan house, whom he meets when he go there to deliver a 
              packet. Impressed with her inner beauty Vishnu meets her more often 
              and understands her well. When he goes to deliver Archana another 
              packet, it blows up in the Orphan house. Since Archana is the receiver 
              of the packet bomb, she is arrested for the offense. <br/>
<br/>
              Vishnu takes care of her by meeting her regularly in the jail. After 
              a few visits he gets a letter from Archana that she is suffering 
              with blood cancer. After knowing the fact Vishnu takes a bail for 
              Archana on the grounds of her health and takes her to his house.<br/>
<br/>
              After the flashback is over, the envying family of Ramkoti turns 
              sympathetic to her. Sirisha wants Vishnu to marry Archana. Upon 
              the instance from Ramakoti's family Archana and Vishnu agree to 
              get married.<br/>
<br/>
              Then the story leads to the most heart touching climax. You must 
              watch this film on the bigger screen to find out what is there in 
              store for you in the climax. </font></p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists:</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Dr. Mohan Babu:</b> Only Dr. Mohan Babu can fit the role of 'Postman'. 
            This role needs a person who is down to earth and can talk a pure 
            Telugu. Dialogues by Mohan babu are extraordinary. He carried this 
            film on his shoulder with spectacular performance. He makes us feel 
            for him all the time.<br/>
<b>Soundarya:</b> Soundarya is the best fit for this matured role. 
            She did go to the extent of announcing that she will not accept remuneration 
            for this film as her performance would get her a national award.<br/>
<b>Raasi:</b> Raasi, the hottest heroine in Telugu film Industry, 
            is fine tuning herself to become uni-fit (fit for all kind of roles) 
            actress.<br/>
<b>Kota:</b> He is at his usual best as a transformed evil maternal 
            uncle.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Story</b>: There was a lot of gossip going around in the industry 
            that Postman is a straight lift of a award winning Japanese flick, 
            'Postman Blues'. But the fact is the only two characters are taken 
            as inspiration for this film and Vishnu Vardhan has woven the sensitive 
            story around the basic plot. It heartening to see a film with a good 
            storyline.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Direction:</b> This film is a director's special. Muppalaneni Siva, 
            the man behind the blockbuster 'Raja', is the right kind of director 
            for this film. He balanced the emotional film with very good comedy 
            track by MS Narayana, Brahmanandam and Ali. One interesting statement 
            came from Dr Mohan Babu on 13th Jan, 2000 that he is going to own 
            the fate of the film (i.e. he wants people to give the entire credit 
            for success/failure) to him (and not to Muppalaneni siva?). Quite 
            a debatable issue. Ain't?<br/>
<br/>
<b>Dialogues:</b> Dialogues are the lifeline of this film. Tts a lovable 
            experience for the Paruchuri brothers to write dialogues to Mohan 
            Babu as they can experiment and exhibit their proficiency in writing 
            inspiring/inflammatory/intimidating dialogues for Dr. Mohan Babu and 
            be rest assured that they would be delivered in the way they expect 
            them to be.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> Vandemataram did a great job by providing six foot tappers 
            in this film. This kind of music will do well if the film is liked 
            by the people.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Songs:</b> You can see Mohan Babu doing a few variety dances(Suchitra 
            Trademark) in these songs. First song 'Postman' is an introductory 
            song. Second one, 'Bava Bava', is a dream sequence by Raasi. Third 
            one, 'kuku Koyilamma' is a dream sequence by Mohan Babu with Soundarya. 
            Fourth one, 'Acha Tenugula', is another duet for Soundarya and Mohan 
            Babu. Fifth song, Lahiri Lahiri, is another foot tapper with Soundarya 
            and Mohan Babu. Last one 'Raajahamsa Cheera' is the wedding song. 
            All the songs are knitted well into the narration and they give relief 
            to the viewers.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Production:</b> The richness of Yamajatakudu is carried onto 'Postman' 
            </font></td>

<td colspan="2">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This film is 
              a soft and sensitive one. But Muppalaneni Siva never missed any 
              beat of commercialism in this film. It has got all the ingredients 
              one expect from a good film. There is a treat for the Telugu language 
              lovers in this film. Not everyone is fortunate or interested enough 
              to read Jandhyala Papaiah Sastry's 'Pushpa Vilapam'. Soundarya's 
              role is this film epitomizes the 'pushpam'(flower). Mohan Babu would 
              be singing timely 'PushpaVilapam Padyalu' and explaining the gist 
              of them.<br/>
<br/>
              Dialogues in this film needs a special commendation. There is not 
              even a single 'double entendre' dialogue by Mohan Babu in this film. 
              All the dialogues by Dr. Mohan Babu gives an aural kick to the Telugu 
              ear.<br/>
<br/>
              There are few scenes that demonstrate the delicacy at which Muppalani 
              handled them. All of them can only seen and feel on the big screen. 
              They cannot be written about. <br/>
<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comedy 
              track by MS Narayana, Brahmanandam and Ali keeps its pace with the 
              story narration and thickens the main plot by the interval time. 
              We have to wait and see if the predictions by cine pundits turn 
              true. That is ... Alludu Garu... Pedda Rayudu .... Postman! </font></p>
