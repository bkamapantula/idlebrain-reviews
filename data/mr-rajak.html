<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A girl 
                    is dragging a treasure box in a hilly area only to get caught 
                    by a villain gang that is armed with a captor, a jeep, a couple 
                    of horses and of course guns. As that gal is screaming for 
                    help, our hero makes his entrance in a grand scale appearing 
                    in Zorro attire. After a few fights and stunts like riding 
                    standing( a la ajay devagan) on a couple of bikes that are 
                    self operated, you start thinking why so much hungamma is 
                    happening about Hero introduction. Suddenly the gal's box 
                    burst and the 'Pepsi' bottles pop out. Hero sips Pepsi chivalrously! 
                    Yehi hai right choice baby!! Yup! Its an ad shooting for 'Pepsi'. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    Raj Kumar (Mahesh) is doing modeling along with his graduation 
                    at Bombay. After seeing the ad shooting Bombay ad producers 
                    queues up for him. And then Raj Kumar chooses to sing 'Bollywood 
                    BalaRajuni'. After the intro song Raj Kumar go to his uncle's 
                    Hotel in Khandala for the vacation along with his friends. 
                    Raj Kumar and his uncle start talking with swords. During 
                    their conversation, we realize that Raj Kumar and his uncle, 
                    Dhanunjay (Prakash Raj) are like close buddies. Raj Kumar 
                    has no parents and Dhanunjay has no other relatives. <br/>
<br/>
                    Then they show a bus coming to that hotel with a banner of 
                    'Kothi Women College, Hyderabad' on it. You guessed it right! 
                    Rani (Priety Zinta) is the last one to get down from the bus, 
                    as we eagerly wait for the introduction of the heroine. Raj 
                    Kumar falls in love with Rani at first sight. Raj Kumar starts 
                    unabashedly teasing Rani and causes hatred in her. At the 
                    same time, Raj Kumar appears in a cowboy dress on a hill area 
                    with a horse, whip and sword and plays his guitar and do some 
                    feats to attract Rani. Rani drops her pallu which will fly 
                    and fall in the hands of Raj Kumar. Rani starts loving that 
                    cowboy. Again you are right. Rani does not know that the cowboy 
                    is Raj Kumar himself. As we start wondering how long Rajkumar 
                    does his double play with Rani, a team of cops consisting 
                    of Brahmanandam, MS Narayana and Asrani come to Khandala to 
                    catch a guy who did 10 rapes. Enter the cops .. the age old 
                    comedy of constable teasing SI begins ( a la 420, JVAS, Hello 
                    Brother ... ).<br/>
<br/>
                    The rapist, whom these cops are searching, kidnaps Rani right 
                    under the nose of Brahmanandam. Begins the chase. Rapist and 
                    Rani in a maruti van, Cops on a typical Andhra police jeep 
                    and Rajkumar on a bike. Some how rapist fools Cops, but not 
                    Rajkumar. As the rapist got the steering out of his hand. 
                    Van starts running like a wild horse dumping rapist and Rani 
                    out of it and then jumping into a deep valley of Khandala. 
                    *Cut* Rani is hanging to the cliff and rapist holding her 
                    wrist ( a la pawan kalyan and kirthi in toli prema). Rani 
                    relents as rapist asks her to choose between 'mancham ekkadam' 
                    and 'paade ekkadam' ( dialogues by Paruchuri). Meantime our 
                    Raj Kumar stops his bike and changes his attire to cowboy 
                    though his Rani is fighting out with rapist and doing cliff 
                    hanging. When Rani is on the verge of falling from the cliff, 
                    our cowboy enters there scene to rescue her and he also takes 
                    precaution not to show his face to her. Rani is thrilled to 
                    see his cowboy flame thrashing the rapist in different styles. 
                    After the fight is over, Raj Kumar shows mercy on Rani by 
                    closing the curtains down by revealing his identity. Raja 
                    and Rani confirm their love duly followed by a song. During 
                    that evening while doing sword talking with Dhanunjay, Raja 
                    reveals his love for Rani. Suddenly Dhanunjay gets disappointed 
                    and tells Raja not to love any gal, as he has somebody in 
                    his mind. Dhanunjay puts some sentimental dialogues to make 
                    Raj Kumar reject Rani. A tear some Rani verbally thrashes 
                    Dhanunjay before boarding her bus back to 'Kothi College'. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    *Interval* <br/>
<br/>
                    Raj Kumar and Dhanunjay boards train to AP. Prakash Raj starts 
                    telling the flashback. There is a feudal system in Rangapuram. 
                    Thyagamurthy (Krishna) is a landlord of 60 acres. So is the 
                    Sarvarayudu (Jaya Prakash). Being a kind hearted person Thyagamurthy 
                    donates all his land to the farmers who are working for him. 
                    Dhanunjay's sister is married to Thyagamurthy. Dhanunjay is 
                    married to the Sumalatha, sister of Sarvarayudu. Thyagamurty 
                    is making all farmers enlightened about the exploitation by 
                    Sarvarayudu. As Sarvarayudu does not like his farmers to know 
                    about his exploitation kills Thyagamurthy and his wife. Dhanunjay 
                    picks the kid (Raj Kumar) of Thyagamurthy and takes him back 
                    to his house (residence of Sarvarayudu). Sarvarayudu rejects 
                    to accommodate son of Thyagamurthy in his house. An infuriated 
                    Dhanunjay decides to leave that house and stay on his own. 
                    Sumalatha refuses to join his hubby and she prefers to stay 
                    with her brothers ( Sarvarayudu and Bro.). Being an insulted 
                    man, Dhanunjay challenges that he will get Raj Kumar married 
                    to his daughter (who is with Sumalatha now), leaves for Khandala 
                    along with Raj Kumar to become a grand hotelier. <br/>
<br/>
                    By the time flash back is over Raj Kumar and Dhanunjay are 
                    full of tears. Raj Kumar promises Dhanunjay that he will marry 
                    his sis-in-law and duly drops the pallu presented by Rani 
                    through the window of train (It will fly and get stuck to 
                    a red signal light, that's different matter). Enter Rangapuram. 
                    Raj Kumar and Dhanunjay wants to see Sumalatha. They know 
                    that Sarvarayudu family is visiting temple that evening. Dhanunjay 
                    and Raj Kumar visit temple to see Sumalatha and her daughter. 
                    This time too you shot the bull's eye. The daughter of Sumalatha 
                    is none but Rani. These guys make sure that they are not seen 
                    by those women. <br/>
<br/>
                    Kids in Sarvarayudu family are watching 'Shaktiman' in the 
                    TV. Sumalatha forces to put the TV off. And one of the kid 
                    start telling that 'Shaktiman' will come now. Raj Kumar appears 
                    in Zorro dress. He fools around with all the family members 
                    by running around with a sword and then slips in Rani's bed 
                    room. After much dilly dallying they reach basement. Raj Kumar 
                    and Rani starts fighting with swords and Raj starts kissing 
                    her in between the fights and finally manages to disrobe her 
                    with a few quick movements by his sword (Remember the Mask 
                    of Zorro). Then he reveals his identity to brighten the redden 
                    face of Rani. Raj Kumar, Rani and Dhanunjay meet at a place. 
                    Rani reveals that she got engaged to SriHari and her marriage 
                    is in offing. <br/>
<br/>
                    Srihari wins 'KarraSaamu' contest. After a few minutes Raj 
                    Kumar enters the scene to fool around with SriHari ( a la 
                    bavagaru bagunnara). Raj Kumar and Dhanunjay shows a photograph 
                    of Rani with Raj (Raj's face is blackened) and convinces Raj 
                    Kumar that Rani character might not be good. Then SriHari 
                    agrees to make Raj Kumar enter as a London friend of him at 
                    Rani's house ( a la DDLJ). <br/>
<br/>
                    Now the stage is set for the climax. How does Raj Kumar gets 
                    Rani from the clutches of Sarvarayudu? How does Sumalatha 
                    realizes the importance of her hubby Dhanunjay? Will Survarayudu 
                    tolerate the cheating of Raj Kumar? Well, guys, you gotta 
                    watch it on the silver screen!! </font></p>

<b>Direction and Screenplay:</b> The most uncharacteristic direction 
                  by Raghavendra Rao. He tried to do too many things, which resulted 
                  in entropy. He failed to maintain the tempo in the movie. Screenplay 
                  is shabby except for a few scenes.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Photography:</b> Camera work by Vincent is a plus point of 
                  the movie. He captured the beauty of Newzealand and in a new 
                  dimension.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> Music by Mani Sharma is a big plus for this film.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Dialogues:</b> Paruchuri dialogues for the first half are 
                  not up to the mark as it was a love story. But in the second 
                  half dialogues were enjoyable as it involves family drama. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Production:</b> C Aswini did no compromises to produce a 
                  lavishly spent movie. You can see the richness in every frame.<br/>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. 
                  Bollywood Balarajuni:</b> This is the song with Mink Singh with 
                  all Raghavendra Rao kind of masala features. Superb dances by 
                  Mahesh babu. <br/>
<br/>
<b>2. Godari Gattu Paina:</b> This song is one more foot tapper 
                  with a great dance by Mahesh and Priety and it is shot in Newzealand. 
                  <br/>
<br/>
<b>3. Eppudeppudu valapu Chappudu:</b> Shot in Newzealand. A 
                  classic song with decent and variety steps. <br/>
<br/>
<b>4. Enduki Prayamu:</b> One more slow classic song <br/>
<br/>
<b>5. Rama sakkanodamma:</b> This song is the highlight of the 
                  film. Though all songs got good applause, this song got raving 
                  applause. This is the only song in this movie that was fitted 
                  in the interesting part of the story. Nice to see Mahesh and 
                  Preity dance folk steps in Newzealand and they out do each other 
                  in that dance. <br/>
<br/>
<b>6. Indrudo Chandrudo:</b> This is one more mass song. Very 
                  good dances by Mahesh. In the first lyric of this song Priety 
                  is wearing a lambadi dress. She looks very sensuous. </font></td>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                  movie has taken more than an year to make. Script was finalized 
                  4 months after starting the project. Director and producer are 
                  at fault for not starting this movie after script is finalized. 
                  In that process director has to make lots of compromises and 
                  make a half-baked film. The viewer feels clue less. First half 
                  of the movie is boring. Second half is good except for the last 
                  30 minutes. The story of this movie starts just before the interval. 
                  There are some excellent scenes in the second half that will 
                  make us realize how good is Mahesh at comedy. He is got perfect 
                  timing. He will the force to reckon with in the future. Story 
                  is very thin. Treatment is very bad. Plus points of this movie 
                  are Mahesh, Preity, Photography and Songs. We have to wait and 
                  see the box office performance in the weeks to come.</font></td>
