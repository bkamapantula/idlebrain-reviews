<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Story</b><br/>
<br/>
                    The film opens with a series of events that leave an astounding 
                    impact, shown in time intervals of decades about how one blood-seeking 
                    family is trying to annihilate another peace-making influential 
                    family in the land of Rayalaseema. In the process they show 
                    a kid called Indra Sena Reddy occupying the big chair of the 
                    peace making family at a tender age of 8 years.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then 
                    the scene shifts to Varanasi, where the newly appointed UP 
                    governor Chenna Kesava Reddy (Prakash Raj) comes to visit 
                    Varanasi along with his family, which includes a beautiful 
                    daughter Pallavi (Sonali Bendre) who is studying at BHU (Banaras 
                    Hindu University). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                    Pallavi takes holy dip in Ganges her pearl pendant floats 
                    off and adorns the neck of a guy who is also taking holy dip. 
                    According to the mother of Pallavi, if somebody leaves something 
                    that is dear to them in the Ganges at Varanasi, his or her 
                    wishes would come true. But Pallavi does not know that the 
                    pendant reached a person called Shankar Narayan.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Shankar 
                    Narayan (Chiranjeevi) works as a taxi driver to make his living. 
                    He (removed also here) has a trusted lieutenant Valmiki (Tanikella 
                    Bharani) and a loyal assistant Giri (Sivaji). Shankar Narayan 
                    is very fond of his nephew and niece. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
                    seeing Shankar Narayan when he visits BHU where his niece 
                    Nandini is studying, Pallavi realizes that her pendant is 
                    adorned on Shankar Narayan's neck. Nandini and Pallavi are 
                    friends. Pallavi falls in love with Shankar Narayan, as she 
                    believes that as a '<i>Shivudi Aagna</i>' (Command of Lord 
                    Shiva). She acts as a pilgrim and manages to reach Shankar 
                    Narayan's house as guest. She stays there as an orphan. The 
                    Governor is worried that his daughter is missing from University. 
                    He contacts the local mafia people and summons them to search 
                    her daughter. They report to him that she is staying in the 
                    house of a taxi driver named Shankar Narayan and she is in 
                    love with him. Then Governor uses his mafia links to abduct 
                    the family members of Shankar Narayan and transports them 
                    in a train. Shankar Narayan gets hold of a helicopter (owned 
                    by a Muslim friend Khan - played by Punit Issar) and chases 
                    the train to get back his family members.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    irritated Governor lands up at the house of Shankar Narayan 
                    with a fleet of cars carrying armed men. When he spots Shankar 
                    Narayan, he is very much surprised. He salutes Shankar Narayan 
                    and asks him about how and why is he in Varanasi. When Pallavi 
                    says that she is in love with Shankar Narayan, the Governor 
                    requests Shankar to marry Pallavi. But Shankar Narayan says 
                    that he is a responsible guy and he will have to wait till 
                    his niece Nandini is married. Then his loyal assistant Giri 
                    informs that he is in love with Nandini and Nandini also likes 
                    him. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nandini's 
                    marriage with Giri is fixed. When Giri is about to tie the 
                    nuptial knot, a fleet of cars enter the compound with a group 
                    of villains and a beautiful girl gets down from a Mercedes. 
                    That beautiful lady comes to the podium and asks Giri to come 
                    out by calling him as Veera Reddy. The black sheep Veera Reddy 
                    under the guise of Giri comes out and joins the villain gang. 
                    Then the lady tells the crowd that Shankar Narayan is Indra 
                    Sena Reddy. And she challenges Shankar Narayan to come back 
                    to Rayala Seema. </font></p>

                    the last day of <i>Yagnam,</i> the just-release Veera Kesava 
                    Reddy comes to the spot to foil <i>Jala Yagnam</i>. Indra 
                    kills him. As soon as he dies the clouds start becoming darker

                    When Indra Sena Reddy rescues Veera Shankar Reddy's son from 
                    a road accident - Veera Shankar Reddy treats it as a humiliation 
                    and kills his 6-year-old son. In the mean time, her sister 
                    Sneha Latha Reddy (Arti Agrawal) arrives from states after 
                    completing graduation. She falls in love with Indra for his

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indra 
                    realizes that Rayalaseema needs a reservoir to store the water

                    the place suitable for building reservoir.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indra 
                    convinces the collector Chenna Kesava Reddy (who later became 
                    the Governor of UP) that he would make the settlement for 
                    the land if he arranges a meet with Veera Shankara Reddy brothers. 
                    In the meeting the brothers of Veera Shankara Reddy ask to 
                    surrender all the land and houses to them and leave the Rayalaseema 
                    in exchange to their land for reservoir. As the final wish, 
                    Sneha Latha Reddy asks Indra to marry her. Indra accepts all 
                    their demands and says that he would give property immediately, 
                    then marry Sneha Latha Reddy and leave Rayala Seema only after

                    Chiranjeevi is known as the greatest dancer of Telugu cinema 
                    and his dances have not been so exhilarating in his recent 
                    releases. But with Indra, Chiranjeevi is back on the track 
                    as the dancing sensation. His facial expressions and agile 
                    body movements to accentuate the exciting tunes of Mani and 
                    RP are amazing. Chiranjeevi is also known as the mass hero 
                    of Telugu cinema. But, the mass angle was amiss in the latest 
                    films. In Indra, Chiranjeevi dished out a visual treat with 
                    ferocious fights and breathtaking stunts. Chiranjeevi is probably 
                    one of those very few stars of Telugu cinema, who can excel 
                    in any aspect of acting, be it stunts, dances, emoting or 
                    comedy. He has entertained the audience with sensible and 
                    clean comedy in Indra. We have not seen Chiranjeevi utter 
                    ferocious dialogues and make the villain cringe in fear in 
                    a way the frontbencher jumps with joy. Indra is one film where 
                    he delivers powerful and reverberating dialogues with Ã©lan. 
                    To comprehend Chiranjeevi's performance, one might be at loss 
                    of words. He is simply the best and Indra once again echoes 
                    that fact. </font></p>

                    Bendre</b>: The lissome lass Sonali has the entire first half 
                    to dazzle. She has two songs to shake legs with the Megastar. 
                    She suited the role to tee and did her bit to perfection.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Arti 
                    Agrawal</b>: Aarti has a meaty role as a stubborn individual. 
                    She is the perfect cast. She leaves her fans asking for more 
                    as she has just two songs. Thankfully, her dubbing is not 
                    done by Savitha, which gave some freshness and authenticity 
                    to her role of '<i>Seema Ammai</i>'.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other 
                    Cast</b>: Brahmanandam, MS Narayana and Dharmavarapu Subramanyam 
                    gave very good entertainment in the first half as the crooks 
                    who cheat the pilgrims at Varanasi. Brahmanandam is simply 
                    superb. SP Balu acted as singer SP Balu. Prakash Raj is redundant 
                    with his action. Sunil performed well in his cameo role. Tanikella 
                    Bharani is also given a good role.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                    Story</b>: The story of the film is based on a very good commercial 
                    point that is time tested one. Bad man trying to sabotage 
                    the good man and the good man retaliates with his kindness 
                    and when betrayed uses bloodshed and finally delivers a message 
                    that violence is bad and adheres to peace. But the only novel 
                    point in this storyline is taking water problem in Rayalaseema 
                    as the base point against the faction backdrop. Chinni Krishna 
                    has delivered the goods well.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay 
                    - Direction</b>:This film is a B Gopal trademark film. He 
                    knows the emotions of the masses and catches the pulse accordingly. 
                    He is known for canning good action sequences and narrating 
                    flashbacks in style. He proved himself as the undisputed king 
                    at making mass films. The screenplay of the film is very tight 
                    and there is never a dull moment. We observe that B Gopal 
                    has been on back foot in the first halves of his earlier films, 
                    though he has given fine finishing in the end. But in Indra, 
                    he excelled in providing an extraordinary first half too. 
                    Indra would be a perfect birthday gift to him.(He is born 
                    on 24th of July). </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Paruchuri brothers did a fine job in dialogue department by 
                    writing apt dialogues. They did not go overboard in ferocity 
                    section of dialogues. The best dialogues of the film come 
                    in the lead scene to climax where Chiranjeevi comes to the 
                    house of villain and dare him. There are political oriented 
                    dialogues as well for Chiru.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Choreography</b>: 
                    Lawrance has done a fantastic job along with Raju Sundaram 
                    for this film. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Songs:</b> 
                    Mani Sharma and RP did wonderful job for songs. The background 
                    music is also very impressive. Here is the song sequence in 
                    the film</font></p>
<blockquote>

                      Bham Bhole</a>: This lengthy song appears short on screen 
                      as it engrosses us more into it. Chiranjeevi has done slow 
                      classical steps choreographed by Lawrance. This song is 
                      shot in Varanasi backdrop. The steps done by Chiranjeevi 
                      with red dress are amazing. (Song rating 4.5/5)</font></p>

                      blue, green, white and yellow) and cool steps by Chiranjeevi 
                      and Sonali Bendre. There is one reference to <i>jada</i> 
                      in this song. And Raju Sundaram made sure that he plays 
                      around with that word and choreographed accordingly. During 
                      that word in the song, Chiru runs his fingers down on Sonali's 
                      bare back and is surprised by not seeing a <i>jada</i>.

                      Chiranjeevi mocks the <i>Veena</i>-play is instant hit with 
                      the theater crowds. Lawrence strikes again with this song.

                      and immerses audience into the theme of the film. A nice 
                      situational song beautifully choreographed by Raju Sundaram. 
                      This song has similarities to the rain song in Hindi film

                      again by Lawrence and there are amazing slow and fast steps 
                      that show Chiru teasing Arti Agrawal. (Song rating 4.5/5)</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                    addition to the six songs, there is one bit song where Chiru

                    exhibits stage fear to start the song.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    The photography of VSR Swamy is just normal. He did not use 
                    lighting properly in the film and you can see different light 
                    shades for different shots of same scene. He should have taken 
                    care of it. The picturization of train chase with helicopter 
                    and canning of songs is pretty good.</font></p>

                    word and delivered a gem of a film. It's a perfect offing 
                    from a production house that is in business for the past 25 
                    years. Indra indeed is Aswini Dutt's way of celebrating his

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    <br/>
                    First half is a perfect blend of mass and class elements. 
                    It's extraordinary. The interval scene gives the right finishing 
                    touch to the first half. The second half has typical B Gopal 
                    Kind of action sequences. But, at the same time the saint-like 
                    attitude and revenge seeking vigor is judiciously mixed for 
                    Indra Sena Reddy character. Second half of the film is excellent. 
                    This film is an 18 reel film, which leaves you in theater 
                    for about 2 hours and 50 minutes. But you would enjoy every 
                    moment of it. Another best thing about this film is that Chiranjeevi 
                    is shown as a 30+ guy, which adds some authenticity for the 
                    hero characterization. You can go to this film with full expectations 
                    and still you get what you want. This film is a super hit 
                    for sure. But what needed to be seen is if this film becomes 
                    industry's number one or not. Only future will tell!!</font></p>
