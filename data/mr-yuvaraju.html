<br/>
                    Srinivas(Mahesh Babu) just returns to India and joins a college 
                    in Hyderabad. There is this sexy dame called Srivalli(Saakshi 
                    Sivand) that attracts him with her looks. As we proceed a 
                    little bit we come to know that there is a friend for Srivalli 
                    called Vamsi(Venkat) in abroad whom she regards as her best 
                    friend and keeps him close to her heart as when a plane crashed 
                    20 years back these two are the only survivors of the tragedy(Anybody 
                    listening?). Sreenivas also realizes that Srivally is a founder 
                    member of Shanti Nilayam and she is an avid social service 
                    activist. She do not reveal these two facts(One: She has no 
                    parents Two: She runs a orphanage) to any of her collegemates 
                    as she do not want to get their sympathy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally 
                    Srnivas and Srivalli comes to know that they are in love with 
                    eachother. They break the news followed by a lavish engagement 
                    ceremony. For the placid viewers then comes the excitement 
                    in the form of Srilata(Simran) who arrives in nick of time 
                    to attend the engagement. Srivalli comes to know that these 
                    guys know eachother in abroad from the brief observation at 
                    her engagement ceremony.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Upon 
                    inquiring Srinivas admits that Srilata was his tour guide 
                    when he visited Europe. They do not share any other relationship 
                    than being good friends. Later on we come to know that Srilata 
                    has a kid called Teja(Harsha Vardan). Srilata admits to Sreenivas 
                    that her husband has left her. Meantime, the deprived son 
                    Teja shares deep bond with Sreenivas.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
                    the day of wedding is approaching fast, the thick plots unveils 
                    by Sreenivas suspecting that there is something fishy about 
                    Srilata. When he forces her to admit the story behind her 
                    marriage then Srilata confesses that when Sreenivas visited 
                    Europe, they happened to get blown with the magic liquid that 
                    was given by tribals out there. In the state of inebriation, 
                    the body chemistry worked out and the inevitable happened. 
                    It was only realized when Srilata came to know that she has 
                    become pregnant after three months. In fact, Srilata loved 
                    Sreenivas with all her heart. So she decided to give birth 
                    to the kid and see Sreenivas in him/her. That's how Teja came 
                    onto earth kicking and alive. Incidentally Teja happen to 
                    listen this confession between Sreenivas and Srilata.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
                    the situation is clear. A happy Srivalli is getting ready 
                    for the eventful day of her life, wedding with Sreenivas. 
                    Sreenivas is in fix to decide why it happened to him(He had 
                    a kid as a result of the magic tribal liquor consumed and 
                    the acts there after). Srilata happened to meet Sreenivas 
                    accidentally on the day of his engagement. She cannot break 
                    the engagement and spoil the happiness of Srinivas. Teja knows 
                    that Sreenivas is his father. But he cannot call him his father 
                    as he promised his mother that he won't let Sreenivas know 
                    that Teja knows the fact. Meantime Vamsi is flying down to 
                    India and propose his love to Srivalli.</font></p>

                    Babu</a> did not have enough opportunity to do sentimental 
                    action. This film has provided him a platform to exhibit the 
                    real acting histrionics. He made most of this opportunity 
                    by acting like a veteran. Dances are even better than that 
                    of <i>Rajakumarudu</i>. He reaffirmed his one-man-ship with 
                    a mime sequence that last for 5 minutes which really hilarious 
                    and enjoyable. Its hard to see Mahesh Babu in the role of 
                    father. But his princely charmingness carried the onus and 
                    did justice to his role.</font></p>

                    She is given 5 songs in this films in which she danced with 
                    gay abandon along with Mahesh Babu.</font></p>

                    the whole second half with her demure and under played emotions. 
                    She is given two songs in this film. The first one is a slow 
                    song with her cute kajol kind of tomboyish hair cut and another 
                    one in a set erected in Talakona Forest that has the most 
                    massive mass lyrics like <i>Olammo Olakko Ornayano penned</i>

                    are played by Mahesh Babu, Saakshi Sivanand and Simran. The 
                    only difference is that Namrata dies in the Hindi version 
                    in half and Simran stays full. This story of Yuvaraju is pretty

                    and he proved that he can show the sensible relationships 
                    between the characters in his films. But he must realize that 
                    making a scene/shot perfect is not the only thing. He must 
                    make sure that all these well pictured shots should be knitted 
                    well enough to hold the attention of viewers. The holistic 
                    approach is missing in his direction. He did an excellent 
                    job in picturization of songs with exotic flavor.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music:</b>
<a href="../../celeb/interview/interview_ramanagogula.html">Ramana 
                    Gogula</a> has given very good music. Though a couple of tunes 
                    are lifted from a Hindi film and a few English albums. But 
                    his touch of magic is intact. The background music is good 
                    and it appears familiar as he tried to score the tunes of 
                    Hindi film as the background music there by making us remotely 
                    familiar. He effectively used the '<i>they dont really care 
                    about us</i>' beat from Michael Jackson's song for all the 
                    scenes in which Sreenivas meets Teja. But its an excellent 
                    improvisation and it resembles there feelings of Teja who 
                    feels that '<i>nobody cares about him</i>'.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    The camera work by Ajay Vincent is simply superb. This man 
                    who won the Nandi award last year for '<i>Premante Idera</i>' 
                    has done a superior job in this film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                    Burugapally Siva Rama Krishna let him money purse lose for 
                    this time and all that you see on screen is stinking rich 
                    and it even competes the superiority of Aswini Dutt in the 
                    lavish scale this film was produced. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    Finally, this film that was slated for 14th January released 
                    has seen the day of light after 90 days of lag. First half 
                    is boring as all it showed is showcasing Mahesh Babu in different 
                    attires and there by failing to hold the interest of viewers. 
                    But it was the second half that has taken a U turn. With the 
                    entrance of Simran the story showed the signs of spark and 
                    with the arrival of Teja the movie goes into a gripping mode. 
                    But the length taken to narrate story is pretty long which 
                    makes the viewer feel bored. This film is recommendable if 
                    you like 'Hindi' style of scenes picturization. Some of shots 
                    in the second half are straight lifts from '<i>Jab Pyar Kisi 
                    Se Hota Hain</i>'. There is nothing wrong in getting inspired. 
                    But the creativity lies in improvising it and making it better 
                    than the original. We gotta wait and watch how the masses 
                    receive this film that is hard to digest in terms of storyline 
                    and the characterization of Mahesh Babu. Please wait till 
                    the trade reports pour in</font></p>
