                    of the movie starts with showing the travails of child labor. 
                    Immediately after titles, a computer screen appears in which 
                    the user chooses a love story as the option. Then the real 
                    story of the movie unfolds in the glamour capital of India, 
                    Bombay. Victorious Terminus platform is buzzing with the exuberant 
                    visitors from all the suburbs, who came to downtown to celebrate 
                    the new year. Yup! It is the midnight of 31st December. A 
                    sober looking middle aged man trying to catch-up the excitement 
                    realizes that there something amiss for the cute teenage lad 
                    who is sitting beside him. Raja(Kunal), is looking very sad 
                    gazing into non existing emptiness. That middle aged man asks 
                    him about the reason for Raja's sadness and try to comfort 
                    him with a few kind words. Raja starts telling his story ...... 
                    here you Go!! <br/>
<br/>
                    **Flashback** <br/>
<br/>
                    A teenage lad, Raja, from the interiors of AP lands up in 
                    VT to attend an interview for the prestigious management school 
                    in India "RamaChandra Institute of Management(RIM)". But what 
                    he lack is financial background. His father is blacksmith, 
                    who can't afford Raja studies. Raja go to Nariman Point and 
                    rests on a cement bench on the sea face with his 'trunk pette'. 
                    He slips into a sound sleep as the sea breeze make him comfortable. 
                    An old man(Nazar) spots this talented guy and manages a seat 
                    for Raja in RIM. As you have guessed by now, RamaChandra, 
                    the founder of RIM is none but the old man (Nazar) who spotted 
                    Raja. <br/>
<br/>
                    Raja gets admitted into RIM, which has a pay cyber cafe, and 
                    somehow hits off well with the computers. One fine day Raja 
                    enters MIRC chat and start chatting with SUMAM. Sonali is 
                    the gal who had a nick called sumam. That gal introduces herself 
                    as a married female with kids to Raja. And Raja still wants 
                    to befriend her. Later on Sumam apologizes for giving wrong 
                    info to him and lets him know the real intro. And she asks 
                    him to guess her real name using her nick. Raja hits the bull's 
                    eye in second guess by say 'Roja'. This is the beginning of 
                    Boons &amp; Millers romantic story between Raja and Roja. Only 
                    wrong info they conveyed to each other is that Raja is from 
                    London and Roja is from US of A. In fact, both of them are 
                    chatting in same cyber cafe. They start kutchi-kooing over 
                    net. Its a different matter that after a month Raja gets a 
                    bill of Rs 5000/- for his chats. Meantime Raja and RamaKrishna 
                    become very close buddies. RamaKrishna gives a thorough encouragement 
                    for Raja about love. Raja asks Roja for her picture and she 
                    emails him. He also emails his picture to her. It so happens 
                    that when Roja opens Raja's pic, Raja see Roja in real. Both 
                    of them are shocked as they expect their chat partners to 
                    be in abroad. They smile at each other without uttering a 
                    single word. <br/>
<br/>
                    Raja and Roja catches the same VT bound 8:10 train in Bandra 
                    Station every morning. They look at each other and smile, 
                    but no talks. They know that they love each other, but they 
                    are too shy to approach each other with a proposal. There 
                    was an annual function declaring the top 10 Management colleges 
                    of India. Gupta Institute of Management (GIT) bags the second 
                    place. Son of Mr Gupta was asked to receive the award. RIT 
                    grabs the first place and daughter of RamaChandra receives 
                    the award. As you might have guessed the daughter of Ramachandra 
                    is none but Roja. When the Numero Uno award was announced 
                    our hero Raja was conveniently sent by the director to a toilet. 
                    At that time Mr Gupta comes to a conclusion that his son and 
                    Roja can be the best combination for the marriage. And it 
                    is evident that Raja is still not aware of Roja being the 
                    daughter of his mentor RamaChandra. <br/>
<br/>
                    *Interval* <br/>
<br/>
                    Raja confess his mentor that he spotted his net friend in 
                    real and say that he is in love with her. RamaChandra encourages 
                    him to the extent that he is ready to write a love letter 
                    that is given to Roja by Raja. Ultimately Roja composes the 
                    love message on the request by her dad, without knowing that 
                    the destination of that letter is none but her. Raja hands 
                    over his love letter to her at Bandra station and it was misplaced 
                    while she was traveling in train. Roja hands over her a love 
                    letter to him next day at Bandra station, which too was somehow 
                    misplaced. <br/>
<br/>
                    Raja starts thinking that Roja is not loving him as she did 
                    not respond to his lover letter. Same is the case with Roja. 
                    As viewers are squirming in seats with tension, Raja comes 
                    to know that Roja is the daughter of Ramachandra. By that 
                    time Gupta fixes the marriage talks with RamaChandra. A disheartened 
                    Raja finally decides to favor his mentor to his lover. Raja 
                    asks Ramakrishna why Ramakrishna pampers Raja so much. Ramakrishna 
                    tells his flashback about his pathetic travails of childhood 
                    (Incidentally the cement bench on which RamaKrishna spotted 
                    Raja, was his first destination in his childhood). At the 
                    same time RamaKrishna asks Raja if his daughter will agree 
                    to marriage. Raja says that she is going to agree. <br/>
<br/>
                    Meantime Roja sends Raja an email telling that his dad is 
                    willing her to get married to some guy and she loves Raja. 
                    Raja promptly responds to her mailing that explaining that 
                    Roja misinterpreted the Raja friendship as love and he is 
                    not interested. So stage is set now for the grand climax. 
                    We are aware that Raja and Roja love eachother very deeply. 
                    Raja can never ditch his mentor for his love. Ramachandra 
                    will never get Roja married to jr. gupta if he comes to know 
                    that Raja and Roja each other. Roja cannot say no her dad. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    Will Raja gets married Roja? Will Roja gets married Gupta? 
                    Or is there a sad ending with Roja or Raja dying? Will Ramakrishna 
                    come to know that Raja loves none but his daughter? .... well 
                    ... questions are galore! But you must watch this film on 
                    big screen to know the answer. </font></p>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Actors:</b> 
                  Kunal is pretty cute. He is another Abbas in making. He acted 
                  well. Sonali looks very very sensuous sans make-up in this film. 
                  Whenever she smiles, viewer's heart flutters. In a song one 
                  can realize that she has very long legs that never end. Nazar 
                  does his role with ease and charm. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Direction:</b> Direction is the highlight of the film. In 
                  each and every frame you can see the craft work of Kathir. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Screenplay:</b> Kathir has done very slick screenplay, not 
                  compromising over the commercial elements. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Story:</b> Story is sweet. But duration taken to narrate 
                  it is pretty long. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Dialogues:</b> Dialogues are good. But there is no sync 
                  between sounds and lips movement as this is a dubbed movie. 
                  Hence the naturality is lost. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Cinematography:</b> PC Sriram is known for his extraordinary 
                  talent. He did an ultimate job. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Music:</b> A R Rehman gave an excellent tunes as well as 
                  back drop score. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Editing:</b> One can notice a small glitches in the editing 
                  of first half. Otherwise its cool. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Sets:</b> There is an Internet cafe set, which was really 
                  impressive. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Production:</b> A M Ratnam seems to have given entire freedom 
                  for his director and technical team. Technical craft work of 
                  his team is fabulous and uncompromising.<br/>

                  half of the movie is pretty dull and second half is very gripping. 
                  It will appeal only to urbane viewers. The duration of movie 
                  could have been shortened to make movie more interesting. In 
                  this film Kathir drove a noble message across that if one is 
                  not capable of raising children one must do the family planning. 
                  Comedy scenes by Tamil actors are quite bland. If we analyze 
                  scene by scene, all scenes are good. But when we stitch all 
                  these scenes together, there is a common thread missing.</font></td>
