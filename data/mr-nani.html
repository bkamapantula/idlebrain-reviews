                          (Mahesh Babu) is an 8-year-old kid. He is fed up with 
                          the bad treatment meted to him by his mother. When he 
                          attempts suicide, he is rescued by a weird scientist 
                          'Science' (Raghuvaran). Nani tells him that he is fed 
                          up with everybody harassing him in his house. Science 
                          offers him a service that would make 8-year old Nani 
                          into a 28 year old grown-up. Nani accepts the proposal. 
                          Nani becomes big and starts living outside. His mother 
                          lodges a complaint in police station that her son is 
                          missing. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-nani7.jpg" width="150"/>Nani 
                          grabs a job in a Toy manufacturing company as a product 
                          manager. The nature of his job is to play with all the 
                          toys and suggest improvements. He earns quite a handsome 
                          amount. In the process, he interacts with Priya (Amisha 
                          Patel), the daughter of TOY company's chief (Nazar). 
                          Priya is madly in love with Nani. Later on Nani realizes 
                          that his mother loves him and she is missing him a lot. 
                          By looking at the sorry plight of his mother after he 
                          became big, Nani asks Science to revert him back as 
                          kid. When he makes Nani back to 8-year-old kid, there 
                          is a complication. Nani is an 8-year old kid in the 
                          day time and a 28-year old grownup during the night 
                          time. The rest of the film is all about how Nani manages 
                          it.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<img align="right" height="100" src="../../images1/small-nani.jpg" width="150"/><b>Mahesh 
                          Babu</b>: There is an amazing tenderness in the looks 
                          of Mahesh Babu. That same quality shows up as an effective 
                          tool for the portrayal of Nani character (8 going on 
                          28). Mahesh Babu came up with an authentic performance. 
                          He looked stylish and charming in suits. His histrionics 
                          in pathos scenes are genuine.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Amisha 
                          Patel </b>: Amisha Patel is great in the film. She exposed 
                          quite a bit of cleavage and has got tremendous footage 
                          in this film. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-nani2.jpg" width="150"/><b>Others</b>: 
                          Devyani is OK as mother of Nani. However, the voice 
                          of Savitha Reddy is not apt for the role of mother. 
                          She also overdid (like in Tamil movies) in few of the 
                          scenes. The kids (Ashok Galla) who played Nani and his 
                          buddy did well. Aiswarya is irritating as the cigarette-smoking 
                          buddy of heroine, who always speaks in Raghuvaran's 
                          accent. Ali, Brahmanandam and Ravi Babu did the roles 
                          of comedy villains. Sanjay - husband of producer Manjula 
                          - played the role of Devyani's husband in this film. 
                          Sunil provided some unusual comedy with his farts in 
                          climax fight. Nazar and Raguvaran are adequate. Kiran 
                          Rathod, Anjala Zhaveri and Mehak made guest appearances 
                          in the title song of the film. They look very insignificant 
                          in that song.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="right" height="100" src="../../images1/small-nani3.jpg" width="150"/><b>Story: 
                          </b> Story of the film is inspired by Tom Hanks Hollywood 
                          blockbuster 'Big'. Quite a few scenes from that film 
                          are reused as per the convenience. However, story writer 
                          SJ Suryah failed in altering the story as per the nativity. 
                          If Big film has 70% importance to mother-son bonding, 
                          Nani film has 70% importance to romance between the 
                          lead pair.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-nani5.jpg" width="150"/><b>Screenplay 
                          - direction</b>: Screenplay by SJ Suryah is insipid. 
                          Direction is not up to the mark. Narration is very slow 
                          and boring at times. He tried to depend more on creating 
                          situations that explore conflict between the sexual 
                          desire of Amisha character and the innocence of Nani 
                          than trying to exploit the tender relationship between 
                          son and mother. The Telugu movie lovers who have seen 
                          SJ Suryah in a full form in films like Vaali and Kushi 
                          end up being taken for a ride for 'Nani'. SJ Suryah 
                          said in an <a href="../../celeb/interview/interview_sjsurya.html">interview</a> 
                          given to idlebrain.com that "A music director can 
                          bear 10 flops. A hero or heroine can bear six flops 
                          each. If a director delivers one flop, the industry 
                          will throw him away." SJ Suryah should have kept 
                          that point in his mind while making this film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="right" height="100" src="../../images1/small-nani8.jpg" width="150"/><b>Music</b>: 
                          The songs of the film fall short of what we expect from 
                          a music director of AR Rehman caliber. AR Rehman disappoints 
                          with his background score. It does not sound like AR 
                          Rehman's at all. Among the songs, Vasta Nee Venuka stands 
                          out followed by Amma song. They have used filters for 
                          'Chakkera Ekkada Nakkina'. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-nani9.jpg" width="150"/><b>Photography</b>: 
                          Photography by Guhan is different. But what made the 
                          whole film looked unusual are the weird camera angles 
                          and contorted lens adjustments. These kind of photographic 
                          techniques are good if they were used for 5% of the 
                          scenes in the film. But it definitely irritates you 
                          if they were used for major part of the film. Another 
                          artificial factor about the photography is the lighting 
                          scheme used. Blue color dominates the film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="right" height="100" src="../../images1/small-nani10.jpg" width="150"/><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                          Dialogues by Sobhan are OK. He made good use of words 
                          while writing dialogues that appear to have 'double 
                          meaning' for the situations involving Amisha Patel and 
                          Mahesh Babu. The dialogue 'Eee lokamlo chedipoyina aadavallu 
                          vundochu kaani chedda amma vundadu' is heartening. He 
                          also used the code word of 'Gurram Ekkadam' referring 
                          sexual intercourse. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Other 
                          departments</b>: Art work is trendy. Editing is OK. 
                          Choreography for 'Vasta Nee Venuka' is enticing. Other 
                          songs (except for Amma song) have fast/rap steps. Production 
                          values of the film are extravagant. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img align="left" height="100" src="../../images1/small-nani7.jpg" width="150"/><b><font color="#0000FF">Analysis</font></b>: 
                          First half of the film is boring. Second half is slightly 
                          better. The movie suffers from artificialness and bad 
                          script. Nani stands as perfect example of how sound 
                          and camera is being misused (they used weird camera 
                          angles and stunts-related sounds even for the scenes 
                          involving son-mother). All the scenes and song (Markandeya) 
                          involving Ramya Krishna were deleted. However, there 
                          are a couple of good scenes (pathos scene involving 
                          Devyani and Mahesh - Comedy scene of first night for 
                          Mahesh Babu and Amisha Patel). 'Nani' is a bad film. 
                          Mahesh should not have accepted this film. We have to 
                          wait and see if Mahesh's image comes to rescue of 'Nani'.</font></p>
