<br/>
                    This movie starts with a variety titles clipping. Instead 
                    of giving importance to the star cast, EVV has made all his 
                    technicians (including light boys and clap boys) introduce 
                    themselves to the audience. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Praveen 
                    (Naveen) and Subadra (Raasi) are lovers and they decide to 
                    elope as their parents have other plans for them. They fix 
                    up bus stand as the venue and decide upon 11 pm as the time. 
                    But due to some reasons Praveen could not come to the bus 
                    stand and an embarrassed Subadra is caught red-handed by her 
                    parents.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cut</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                    is a colony called prem nagar in Hyderabad and there lives 
                    a beautiful couple Jagdeesh (Srikanth) and Subadra. Jagdeesh 
                    works in a car showroom as a marketing manager. He tries all 
                    the ways to impress his wife, but to no avail. She does not 
                    let him touch her body and makes his life miserable with her 
                    indifference towards him.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Praveen 
                    joins the company where Jagdeesh is working. They become friends 
                    quickly and Jagdeesh finds a house just beside his house. 
                    Praveen along with his wife Kanaka Durga (Laya) joins the 
                    house. It took no time for Praveen to realize that his pre-marriage 
                    lover is the wife of his new friend Jagdeesh. And the strong-hearted 
                    Subadra was initially unhappy with Praveen for the way he 
                    left her in lurch at the bus stand. But later on realizes 
                    the real story behind Praveen not coming (he was beaten by 
                    his father and was forcibly put in unconsciousness for ten 
                    days till Subadra got married).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Willing 
                    Subadra feels that a woman can love only once in her life 
                    time and cannot continue the relationship with her hubby and 
                    she asks Praveen to take her away and marry her. Praveen tries 
                    to explain her how good Jagdeesh is. Subadra is aware of the 
                    kindness and greatness of Jagdeesh. But she is not wiling 
                    to accept him as her husband as she could not forget Praveen.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
                    fine day, both of them whisk away to Goa by informing their 
                    spouses that they are going on a trip for different reasons. 
                    After staying in a hotel, the guiltiness in Subadra starts 
                    growing. They get to know a couple, GV(Prakash Raj) and Avanti(Abantika) 
                    who are ex-classmates of Praveen. Incidentally, this couple 
                    too has the similar background. Only difference is that Avanti's 
                    husband resorts for suicide after her elopement with GV. Subadra 
                    slowly starts realizing the importance of her husband Jagdeesh 
                    and suspects her lover Praveen of materialistic motives behind 
                    eloping with her. After a few days of stay in the hotel, Subadra 
                    leaves back to Hyderabad by leaving a note to Praveen that 
                    she prefers staying with her husband then eloping and remarrying 
                    Praveen. </font></p>
<p></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mean 
                    time, Kanaka Durga comes to know that her hubby has eloped 
                    with her neighbor's wife. She starts treating Praveen nastily 
                    after his journey of Goa. Subadra resorts to a sudden suicide 
                    after the critical remarks on her by the neighboring society. 
                    Kanaka Durga decides to go for abortion as she feels her child 
                    should not be the son of an evil minded Praveen. As we travel 
                    to the Mediciti hospital for climax we come to know that the 
                    docs out there are none but GV and Avanti.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
                    you have some cinema sense, you must have guessed what actually 
                    happened in the film by now. Even if you know the entire story, 
                    you must watch this film for its gripping screenplay on bigger 
                    screen for better feeling.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Performances:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Srikanth:</b> 
                    Srikanth got used to play this kind of 'maha manishi' characters 
                    in the past too. And he did he part with consummate ease in 
                    this film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Naveen:</b> 
                    Naveen did his role with same ease. But his dancing ability 
                    was given a back seat as the songs he danced have less scope 
                    for dances.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Raasi</b>: 
                    Raasi is the pillar of this film. She has done her schizophrenic 
                    lover role excellently. All the negative shades of the character 
                    are projected well by her with out attracting too much of 
                    hatred ness towards her by the viewers.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Laya: 
                    Laya did well as an innocent wife. </b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Story 
                    - Screenplay &amp; direction</b>: Story of the film can be 
                    told in 3 lines. But what made the viewers glue to the seats 
                    through out 2 and half hours without squirming their butts 
                    is the gripping screenplay. EVV stitched all the scenes with 
                    perfection and injected the heavy sentiment compensated by 
                    adulterated comedy. You do know what's going to happen in 
                    the next scene. But, still you get amazed the way he conveyed 
                    the gripping series of scenes to the audience using his innovative 
                    director's brush on the celluloid. EVV made sure that story 
                    is hero for his film. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    A special mention should go for the dialogues in this film. 
                    Janardhan Maharshi, along with his team of writers, made the 
                    viewers clap for his powerful dialogues on 'Thaali' in this 
                    film and at the same time he could attract uncontrollable 
                    giggles from the viewers with his adult comedy dialogues. 
                    </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                    Srinivasa Murthy grabbed the opportunity given to him with 
                    both hands. But, like many other films, his music got elevated 
                    only in the situational songs like 'Rama Chilakamma' and 'Gatame 
                    Jataga Talachi'. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    Jayaram's photography is good as usual.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis:</b> 
                    This film is made with simple story and super screenplay. 
                    Only drawback of the film is the adult comedy injected in 
                    this film. But I could notice a thunderous applause from the 
                    audience for the comedy strips in a B center like Hindupur. 
                    But, the strength of the film is shown in the EVV's handling 
                    of the subject 'Thaali' and treating the character of 'Subadra', 
                    married women who eloped with her lover, with utmost sanctity 
                    through out the film. This film is a must watch one for all 
                    the EVV movie lovers. Otherwise too, it is strongly recommended 
                    if you can enjoy(or bear with) the adult comedy.</font></p>
