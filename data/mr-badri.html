<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Badri 
                    (Pawan Kalyan) is an ad agency director whose parents are 
                    settled in USA. He has a ladylove called Vennela (Renu Desai), 
                    who incidentally is a close family friend of Badri's family. 
                    Their parents too want these two lovers to tie the knot. Badri 
                    and Vennela are whiling away time, as Vennela did not finish 
                    her grads yet. <br/>
<br/>
                    On one of those romantic evenings, Vennela expresses Badri 
                    that she loves him very much. But at the same time she does 
                    not find the same sincerity in the love of Badri. She also 
                    challenges him that no other girl on earth would probably 
                    love him more than she does. Badri, who has a weakness of 
                    getting carried away in arguments, takes up the challenge 
                    immediately. Vennela shows a beautiful girl coming out of 
                    the temple and asks him to patao that girl. Then Vennela goes 
                    to US to spend time with the parents of Badri. Badri gets 
                    the bio-data of the new girl in no time and finds out that 
                    her name is 'Sarayu'. She is a pampered yet docile sister 
                    of Nanda (Prakash Raj). After doing a few stints he was able 
                    to corner Sarayu to the extent that she expresses her love 
                    to him and puts forward a marriage proposal for which Badri 
                    gives no response. <br/>
<br/>
                    Meantime, Vennela is back and could estimate the body chemistry 
                    between Sarayu and Badri. Then she starts regretting for betting 
                    with Badri. Badri too was torn between his two ladyloves. 
                    Nanda, the brother who is excessively fond of his sister Sarayu, 
                    guns for the blood of Badri, as he knows that Badri and Vennela 
                    are destined for marriage. <br/>
<br/>
                    As we head for a simple looking yet extremely gripping climax, 
                    we have a very heart-touching performance in store. It is 
                    advisable to watch it on the big screen than knowing the climax 
                    before hand. </font></p>

                    Artists:</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Pawan Kalyan:</b> He is gone a step ahead in terms of emoting 
                    in this film. But he tries to portray too much about him which 
                    probably look like he do not deserve. Pawan Kalyan is such 
                    an actor that if supported by a good story and characterization 
                    can carry the entire burden on him and give a run a way hit. 
                    But he did not reach a position where he can deliver a big 
                    hit with his screen presence alone. As an actor, he excelled 
                    exceedingly well. There are few gems and sparks of scenes 
                    in which he proved his ability to show versatility. There 
                    is one particular shot in climax in which he acted with such 
                    a precision that we feel like seeing Chiranjeevi in place 
                    of him. His dialogue delivery has increased tremendously compared 
                    to the earlier films.<br/>
<b>Amisha Patel:</b> If you have seen 'Kaho Naa Pyar Hain' 
                    and if you want the same kind of Amisha Patel in this film 
                    you will be subjected to disappointment. She looks very prim 
                    in this film with innocent kind of looks. She wore all traditional 
                    dresses(Except of 'Ey Chekitta') in this film.<br/>
<b></b><b> Renu Desai:</b> She is the surprise pack of the 
                    film. She is given more footage than Amisha Patel and she 
                    carried her role with the dignity of a sincere lover and carefree 
                    attitude of a teenager. Her presence in the film made a difference.<br/>
<b>Prakash Raj:</b> She did this role of a pampered relative 
                    again. Only difference in his earlier films and this film 
                    is that he did not take any class in this film.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Other Departments</b><br/>
<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay 
                    &amp; Direction:</b> Jagannath did try something different. 
                    But failed to make a universal film that can appeal to all 
                    the classes. His characterization of 'Vennela' is excellent. 
                    But he could not justify the mystic, enigmatic and surreptitious 
                    characterization of 'Badri'. All the scenes that followed 
                    after Vennela returned from USA are very well directed. For 
                    a debutante, its a ice try. But he lack in making the mass 
                    elements click in the film.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music</b>: Ramana Gogula did give good music for songs 
                    and background in this film. 'I am an Indian', 'Bagalakhatam' 
                    and 'Ey Chikitta' are going well with the viewers. All songs 
                    are very good and well pictured. But will they go well with 
                    the masses. For example 'Ey Chikitta' has got excellent music 
                    in which he Pawan Kalyan can dance like a madmax. But instead 
                    he preferred to have walk around in cowboy dress. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cinematography</b>: 
                    The camera work by Madhu Ambat is very commendable. Especially 
                    those songs that are canned in South Africa.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production:</b> 
                    T Trivikrama Rao is supposed to have spent unlimited amounts 
                    and a few sleepless nights to make this film. All his money 
                    is showing up in form of richness in the film.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you 
                    are expecting another Tammudu out of this film, you have a 
                    big disappointment in the store. The film look smooth and 
                    in the place as long as Vennela character is in place. The 
                    episode of Badri pataoing Sarayu could have dealt in a more 
                    delicate manner. The first half of the first half and second 
                    half of the second half are very well directed. But in between, 
                    the movies makes viewers squirm in the seats. On a whole the 
                    most appreciated things in this film are Fights. He did do 
                    his fights just the way Chiru did in Gangleader. Next comes 
                    the performance of Pawan Kalyan. Third comes the characterization 
                    of Pawan Kalyan. Its an adamant and eccentric one. Pawan Kalyan 
                    gave statement that his attitute is similar to that of Badri(Can 
                    you read in between lines?). Did he get carried away with 
                    that weakness?</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the 
                    other hand, the drawback of 'Badri' characterization is that 
                    Badri is from a rich family and he is proud and adamant guy. 
                    Pawan Kalyan did sympathetic roles in 'Toliprema' and 'Tammudu' 
                    which made him closer the common man so that he can identify 
                    himself. But in this film his adamant nature and eccentrics 
                    made the character have a few negative shades there by not 
                    being liked by everybody. At the same time there are sparks 
                    of casual comments and jokes in this film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The animosity 
                    between Badri and Nanda Their ego clash is shown in a creative 
                    way. The eccentric dialogues of Badri on irritated Nanda make 
                    the viewers thrilled. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
                    you are eagerly waiting or in a hurry to watch this film, 
                    you will get disappointed. But watch this film at your leisure, 
                    you can get the aesthetic juice out of this efferent film.</font></p>
