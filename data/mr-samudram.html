<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sagar 
                    (Jagapathi Babu) is a fun loving guy. His family consists 
                    of a mother, a sister and cute kids in his gully. Enter the 
                    bumping babe Rajya Laxmi! (Saakshi Sivanand). She bumps into 
                    Sagar with a cycle first. Later on she graduates to a kinetic 
                    Honda. Then to a Honda Car. As the bumping vehicle of Rajya 
                    Laxmi gets promoted, the love between Sagar and Saakshi blossoms. 
                    One fine day Rajya Laxmi rolls onto Sagar by calling him a 
                    'Boppas Kai'. Then the family of Sagar meets the family of 
                    Rajya Laxmi to fix up the match. Sagar's sister too gets engaged 
                    to a guy. <br/>
<br/>
                    There is a parallel story running along with the Sagar's love 
                    story. Chepala Krishna (Tanikella Bharani) is a noted smuggler 
                    in Vizag. Chepala Nani (Ravi Teja) is his younger brother. 
                    Both of them rule the rowdy world in the steel city. Chepala 
                    Krishna has an ambition of a life time. He wants to become 
                    an MLA. <br/>
<br/>
                    Krishnam Raju (Sivaji Raja) is the S.I. Of police for that 
                    area. Enter the C.I. of police Sri Hari!! (Sri Hari) He is 
                    the most dreaded and honest Police Officer. With the help 
                    of Krishnam Raju he gets to know about all the criminals in 
                    that area and Chepala Krishna tops the most wanted criminals 
                    list. <br/>
<br/>
                    When Chepala Krishna is about to file his nominations for 
                    the post of an MLA, he gets arrested by Sri Hari. Sri Hari 
                    makes sure that Chepala Krishna would not go to assembly by 
                    booking him as a rowdy sheeter. Since Chepala Krishna has 
                    a criminal case against him, he cannot contest in the elections. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    One fine day a stranger tips off Sri Hari that Chepala Nani 
                    is doing smuggling at a particular place. Sri Hari spots Nani 
                    and starts chasing him with the help of Krishnam Raju. Sister 
                    of Sagar marriage arrangements are going in a full swing. 
                    Sagar goes to bazaar to buy something. As the chase gang (Nani, 
                    Sri Hari and Krishnam Raju) enters a gully, Nani shoots Sri 
                    Hari with a country revolver. From the back side Krishnam 
                    Raju finishes Sri Hari with his police revolver. Sagar enters 
                    the scene and try to rescue Sri Hari only to get caught and 
                    implicated in the murder case of Sri Hari by Krishnam Raju. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    Chepala Krishna takes all the precautions to make sure that 
                    Sagar is sentenced for his life. All this story is shown as 
                    a flash back in the first half as the dejected Sagar, sitting 
                    in a cell, ponders about his good old days. <br/>
<br/>
                    *Interval* <br/>
<br/>
                    Nukaraju (Prakash Raj) is a humble constable, who is transferred 
                    to the Chepala Krishna's area. He is an avid admirer of late 
                    Sri Hari. Sagar's mother gets hospitalized when she resists 
                    Chepala Nani who tried to rape the sister of Sagar. Nukaraju 
                    is on the duty to accompany Sagar to the hospital to visit 
                    Sagar's mom. There Sagar gives Nukaraju a slip and escapes 
                    from the hospital. <br/>
<br/>
                    We have three targets (Chepala Krishna, Chepala Nani and Krishnam 
                    Raju) for Sagar. It's certain that Sagar, being a hero in 
                    the film, would take revenge! If you want to know how Sagar 
                    proves his innocence and gets exonerated from the implicated 
                    case, you must watch this hard hitting exhilarating film on 
                    a tinsel screen with DTS effect.</font></p>

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Actors:</b>
<br/>
<b><br/>
                  Jagapathi Babu:</b> Jagapathi is given a role that demands lot 
                  of emoting. He has to show his vulnerability (that of a naive 
                  citizen of India) and an unstoppable machoism (when he is set 
                  to take revenge over the villains) for this role of Sagar. He 
                  did 100% justice to his role. <br/>
<b>Saakshi Sivanand:</b> She is used as glamour doll in this 
                  film. She did add glitter and gloss to the love part of this 
                  film. <br/>
<b> Tanikella Bharani</b>: This is a role that is never done 
                  before by any other artist so far. All the expressions by him 
                  do have a hard hitting impact over the audience whatever the 
                  form he choose to express, either by blabbering or by mutely 
                  emoting. <br/>
<b> Sri Hari:</b> Sri Hari seems to be going strength to strength 
                  from film to film. After watching him in this role, one cannot 
                  imagine any other actor doing the same role with the same impact. 
                  His dialogue delivery and the voice modulation is simply superb. 
                  <br/>
<b> Prakash Raj:</b> Prakash Raj, best known for evil minded 
                  roles, is given a role of a humble and innocent constable. He 
                  did his act with such a precision that the viewers have two 
                  feelings at a time watching him doing a few scenes. At one end 
                  we would be laughing at his innocence and at the other end we 
                  would be crying for his kindheartedness. Its not an easy task 
                  to evoke two contradictory emotions in the hearts of viewers 
                  at the same time by doing a synchronizing act between the rapid 
                  dialogue delivery and the dynamic change of facial expressions. 
                  <br/>
<b>Sivaji Raja:</b> Sivaji Raja dons a role, which he would 
                  have never done otherwise. He did a role of a materialistic 
                  SI of police. We have a preconceived image of a cine evil cop, 
                  who never fears to do evil acts. But this role is something 
                  different. When Sivaji raja shoots Sri Hari, he shivers like 
                  a leaf with fear. <br/>
<b> Ravi Teja:</b> This time, Ravi Teja dons the role of villain 
                  for a change. But this character has some softness attached 
                  to it. His dialogue delivery is very spontaneous and is a treat 
                  our ears.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Direction and Screenplay:</b> Each and every shot in this 
                  film is meticulously executed. All the scenes leave an impact 
                  on the viewers. Shot making is very good. But story telling 
                  seems to have gone a little out of hand in the second half. 
                  Screenplay is excellent. But the editing in the second half 
                  has a few shortcomings. As a symbolism 'samudram' is shown lot 
                  of times in between scenes. Even though the 'samudram' is shown 
                  in-between various scenes in this film, each time the same samudram 
                  reflect the moods and the emotions of of those particular scenes. 
                  Characterization is done with utmost care.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Photography:</b> S K Bhupathi, the regular camera man for 
                  Krishna Vamsi, did some spectacular work for this film. Camera 
                  movement in this film is very different from the regular stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> Sashi Preetam paired up with Krishna Vamsi after 
                  Gulabi. Very good songs coupled with excellent DTs re-recording 
                  enriches the quality of this film.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Songs:</b> Songs are too good to watch on the silver screen. 
                  The exotic 'Laila O', the extraordinary 'Sonie Sonie', the euphoric 
                  'Hoop Hoop', the exuberant 'Muddula Muthyame' and the ebullient 
                  'Deo Deo' ..... all these songs have a right blend of music, 
                  choreography, photography, lyrics and the creativity of the 
                  director. A performance worth mentioning is that of sensuous 
                  Raasi in 'Muddula Muthyame'.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Producer:</b> Producers seems to have given a free hand to 
                  Krishna Vamsi in this film making. This film looks real glossy 
                  with rich technical values. A brave rewarding effort by the 
                  producers, indeed.<br/>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First 
                  half of the film is excellent and would appeal to all the sections 
                  of people. Second half is not as good as the first half. Though 
                  this film looks very real, there are a few glitches in the second 
                  half which we do not expect from a director of krishna Vamsi 
                  caliber. When Sagar escapes from the police custody, he would 
                  be traveling in Tata safari with gay abandon. There would be 
                  no police to catch him. The obnoxious villain Chepala Krisha 
                  would be fearing about Sagar (who is supposed to be a guy-next-door 
                  sort of character) and seeking solace in a hideout. There is 
                  no suspense in the film reserved for the climax. The concept 
                  of an implicated hero escaping from the custody and taking revenge 
                  on the villain is an oft repeated theme in telugu films (Gang 
                  Leader to name one). Telugu viewers got used to nail biting 
                  climax (with lot of suspense) these days. In this film the climax 
                  is revealed much before the end of the film when Sagar escapes 
                  from the custody. One highlight of this film is the climax that 
                  is set on the backdrop of a Vizag jatara (a la Calcutta's Durgapooja 
                  in Choodalani Undi, Mumbai's Ganesh Immersion in Satya). One 
                  more positive aspect of this film is that there is only one 
                  person dies in the entire film (Sri Hari, that is). A best recommended 
                  film for those all movie buffs who want to experience the nuances 
                  of shot making. We have to wait and see how the telugu viewers
