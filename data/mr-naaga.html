<br/>
                    Nagaraju (NTR) is a law student and the son of a bantroth 
                    (Raghuvaran) - the white dressed man who stands besides judge. 
                    Bantroth's ambition in life is to see his son Naaga as a truthful 
                    and noble lawyer serving the society. In that process, he 
                    spends lot of money on Naaga though he could not financially 
                    afford such a costly education. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chandra 
                    Sekhara Naidu (Nazar) is the CM of the state. The Home Minister 
                    (Rajan P Dev) is looking for an opportunity to destabilize 
                    CM. The HM has an illegitimate affair with a wonton woman 
                    under the guise of social worker called Mandaram (Shakeela). 
                    Mandaram has insatiable thirst for the power. She pressurizes 
                    HM to make her an MLA when an assembly position falls vacant. 
                    When CM refuses to give ticket to Mandaram, the HM join hands 
                    with an opposition leader Potti Kasaiah (Paruchuri Gopala 
                    Krishna) and launches Mandaram as an independent candidate. 
                    In one of such political rally campaigns, the goons happen 
                    to enter the house of Naaga due to some petty quarrel. In 
                    the process, they bruise Naaga's father and sister. In a fist 
                    of anger, Naaga beats those guys black and blue. Those guys 
                    file a case on Naaga for injuring them.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Naaga 
                    impresses one and all in the court by saying how the political 
                    campaigns and street rallies are affecting the privacy and 
                    comfort of common citizens. He also suggests that the politicians 
                    should use electronic media for campaign instead of wasting 
                    money by trying to influence voters with unfair means. His 
                    argument becomes the talk of the town and the headlines in 
                    various newspapers. The CM also gets impressed with Naaga. 
                    All the students unions in AP join hands with Naaga to establish 
                    youth student organizations under one roof in the leadership 
                    of Naaga.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Naaga 
                    campaigns for the ruling party candidate and contributes his 
                    part in the victory. An impressed CM appoints Naaga as the 
                    youth leader for his ruling party. The opposition party uses 
                    the current draught situation in the state as the weapon to 
                    destabilize government. As a reply to this, CM starts fast-unto-death 
                    for Central Government's intervention in this water issue. 
                    Due to some miscommunication, Naaga starts creating law and 
                    order problem to make sure that CM stops his fast-unto-death 
                    and rule the state again. Father of Naaga dies in the process.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    rest of the story is all about how Naaga overcame all the 
                    hurdles and emerge unscathed as a winner.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists</b>:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>NTR</b>: 
                    This movie is made for NTR and hence all the frames and scenes 
                    in the film revolve around NTR. He did his best in dances 
                    and histrionics. His expressions in ferocious and pathos scenes 
                    are effortless. He is at home with his characterization and 
                    did full justice as an actor for his role. His dances are 
                    also pretty entertaining. However, the director created confusion 
                    in the characterization of NTR by infusing too much of aggression 
                    in seemingly an underplayed political film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sada 
                    and Jennifer</b>: Sada, who stole the hearts of youth with 
                    her village belle getup in Jayam, has disappointed the crowds 
                    with this film. Her role is very short and she did not suit 
                    the role well. Jennifer is just a prop in this film for a 
                    couple of songs and a couple of scenes. Her character is not 
                    at all useful for the story.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Raghuvaran</b>: 
                    Raghuvaran played the role of Bantroth and NTR's father. Raghuvaran, 
                    who is seen as a rich father or sophisticated villain so far 
                    has done a character of a middleclass, honest and poor father. 
                    His sophistication and body language does not suit for such 
                    humble middle class characters though he gave his best shot.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Paruchuri 
                    Gopala Krishna</b>: His character of Potti Kasaiah is a natural 
                    extension of his double-statement character in 'Prathidhvani'. 
                    He entertained crowds through his political satires.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nazar</b>: 
                    Nazar did a role of honest Chief Minister who encourages genuine 
                    talents and earnestly work for the people.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rajan 
                    P Dev</b>: The characterization of Rajan P Dev is a big let 
                    down. Rajan, who donned powerful roles of ruthless villain 
                    in Kushi and Aadi did a sober kind of underplayed political 
                    leader. Hence there is no kick in his role.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Others</b>: 
                    Shekeela is given an apt role in this film. She did justice 
                    to the role of a greedy woman with comical outlook. Sudha 
                    got a role where she can emote well. Sunil did the role of 
                    Naaga buddy and provided some entertainment in first half. 
                    </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                    Story</b>: Story by Surya Movies is a serious one with no 
                    scope for entertainment. There are so many unrealistic points 
                    in this movie, which are very hard to conceive and believe. 
                    A better narration and interesting screenplay could have plugged 
                    these holes. Too much usage of violence and politics has taken 
                    the flavor of entertainment out of the film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay</b>: 
                    Screenplay by AM Ratnam needs clarity. But he overplayed the 
                    character of NTR. He tried the pattern of Shankar's 'Oke Okkadu' 
                    for this film. But Shankar handled that film well by underplaying 
                    the character of Arjun most of the times and got the mass 
                    hero in Arjun out for a very few scenes where it was essential. 
                    In an attempt to write a screenplay that is fundamentally 
                    similar to that of 'Oke Okkadu', AM Ratnam ignored the underplay 
                    angle and tried to boost up the image of NTR in mass style 
                    from first frame to the last frame. Hence the mismatch of 
                    theme of the film and treatment of hero has made the screenplay 
                    look pretty mediocre in the first half and confused the crowds 
                    in the second half.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Direction</b>: 
                    DK Suresh direction is average. He failed to provide nativity 
                    touch and in few sentimental scenes we feel like we are watching 
                    a Tamil dubbed film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Paruchuri brothers have done some terrific work in terms of 
                    dialogues in this film. There are 6-7 powerful dialogues. 
                    The best dialogue is - <i>Janaalu Kulam kosam chastaaru. Matham 
                    kosam chastaaru. Kaani Rashtram kosam chavadam lone vundi 
                    raajasam</i>. NTR utters this dialogue with CM and then gives 
                    a typical Rajnikanth's style of wish followed by Rajni's Namaskar. 
                    Another Rajni'sh dialogue in this film is '<i>Nenu edi modalu 
                    pettanu. Kaani okkasaari modalu pettaaka daani antham choose 
                    varaku vadili pettanu</i>'. Paruchuri brothers have saved 
                    some witty dialogues for Potti Kasaish role of Paruchuri Gopala 
                    Krishna. Gopala Krishna referred to NTR as '<i>buddodu kaadu 
                    bulldozer</i>'</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                    Music by Deva and Vidya Sagar has mass orientation. The background 
                    music is OK. There is no smoothness in background music.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Stunts</b>: 
                    Stunts by Vikram Dharma are pretty good. The stylishness and 
                    conceptualization of the first fight is awesome. But too much 
                    of anything is not good for digestion. There are too many 
                    fights and chases in this film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Songs:</b> 
                    There are six songs in this film. Out of six songs, the last 
                    song has got tremendous response, mainly because it is merged 
                    with the situation in film and it comes as a part of the story 
                    narration.</font></p>

                      various stadiums in Hyderabad. This song has got some real 
                      good mass steps by NTR. </font></p>

                      striking similarities with that of 'Ammaye Sannaga' from

                      is pictured on NTR, Sada, Jennifer and buddies of NTR. The 
                      re-recording of this song is not good. </font></p>

                      This song comes when Sada teases NTR and then falls into 
                      waterfalls when NTR chases her. The pattern for this song 
                      is taken from Jyotika's solo from Tamil Kushi. This song 
                      is taken in folk style in picturesque natural locations.</font></p>

                      situation. A badly bruised NTR goes to Jennifer house for 
                      protection. She cleans the mud on his body and while cleaning 
                      the suffering NTR, she kisses NTR and a song appears from 
                      nowhere. Because of the placement, this song has not got 
                      its due credit.</font></p>

                      This song is the best of the lot. Lawrence composed the 
                      steps. Rambha who did a special appearance has slimmed down 
                      a lot. But all she did in this song is to parade herself 
                      as NTR took the center stage with his accentuating body 
                      movements. This song is well connected to the movie's flow. 
                      NTR has done some terrific steps for this song.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    Photography by Ravindra Babu is very good. But it's the editing 
                    and postproduction effects that make the photography glossier. 
                    Some times it appears like the reel is rotated at higher rpm 
                    so that frames come faster than the usual speed.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production:</b> 
                    AM Ratnam has done some terrific job as producer. There are 
                    lots of scenes that involve thousands of junior artists to 
                    be presented at location to create crowd effects. AM Ratnam 
                    has spent lot of money for this film as per the subject's 
                    demand.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    <br/>
                    AM Ratnam, who always preferred hero to be the part of the 
                    story has taken U turn and made this film by making the story 
                    a part of the hero. In an attempt to create a subject that 
                    caters to the masses, he gave too much preference to the unwanted 
                    violence and excessive stunts. There by he had nothing offer 
                    to the female audiences except for few sentimental scenes 
                    that have the scent of Tamil. A hero can only be as powerful 
                    as villain. If the hero is a mass hero, the director needs 
                    to create an equally powerful and dreadsome villain. If the 
                    hero is a strategic hero, the director needs to create such 
                    scenes where the tacit tactics of hero gets elevated (like 
                    those in Shankar films like Gentleman, Bharateeyudu and Oke 
                    Okkadu). By having a villain who looks absolutely weak and 
                    projecting a hero who is unbelievably heroic, the director 
                    could not balance the good and evil equation in the film. 
                    The first half of this film is decent and sensible to certain 
                    extent. But the story in second half meanders aimlessly and 
                    bores you to certain extent. The main asset of the film is 
                    NTR and one may watch this film once for NTR.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Trade 
                    Talk</b>: The universal talk about is film is that first half 
                    is average and second half had drawbacks. Considering the 
                    current form of NTR and advantage of not having big opposition 
                    for Pongal (10 Jan -14 Jan), this film has the chances of 
                    becoming an average fare. The trade pundit opine that it's 
                    a too much of burden on 5-film old youth hero like NTR to 
                    have 190 print release with a weak storyline. However the 
                    openings for this film are terrific.</font></p>
