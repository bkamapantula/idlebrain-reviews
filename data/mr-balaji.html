<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Balaji 
                    (Naveen) is an ambitious dynamic youngster with ideas. His 
                    parents are old aged and belong to a middle class family. 
                    Balaji aims for the sky and falls flat on his face every time. 
                    In that process he is entrapped in debt amounting 10 lacs. 
                    Balaji has a sister-in-law called Sujatha (Laya), who loves 
                    him to the hilt. Balaji is also favorable for the idea of 
                    marrying her. As Balaji fails in all his ventures, his money 
                    lenders are after his blood. Balaji, the man in disguise, 
                    chooses the convenient way of forgoing problems, i.e. he commits 
                    suicide by jumping into sea. He insures an LIC amount of 10 
                    lacs for his money lenders. Sujatha makes herself a widow 
                    (though she is not married to Balaji) and starts staying along 
                    with the parents of Balaji. <br/>
<br/>
                    Ramana(Sudhakar), a fisherman, traps the body of Balaji and 
                    saves him. Penchalyya (Brahmanandam) is the owner of the boat, 
                    who owes huge amount of money to Balwinder Singh (Satyanarayana). 
                    Penchalayya interprets Balaji to be a rich man and Balaji 
                    acts as a dumb and deaf guy for the sake of his convenience. 
                    A harassed Balwinder grabs the boat as the security for the 
                    money Penchalaiah owes to him. Then the 'comedy of errors' 
                    start that ends up in Penchalaiah keeping Balaji and Ramana 
                    as the security for his money and going back with his boat. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    There it is! A huge palatial building called 'Punjabi House'. 
                    It has got lot of family members of Balwinder Singh and a 
                    number of servants. The main family members include Pooja 
                    (Maheswari), Sishwa and Sikandar (Vinod Kumar). Pooja is dumb 
                    girl by birth. Sishwa and Sikandar are her siblings. They 
                    find it difficult to get a suitable guy for Pooja, because 
                    she is a dumb girl. Sikandar is in Delhi searching for a sardarji 
                    for Pooja and incidentally finds one (Harbhajan Singh). Pooja 
                    is reluctant to marry the Harbhajan Singh as she comes to 
                    know that he is after her money. Meantime Balaji succeeds 
                    in wooing Pooja inadvertently. Pooja and Sishwa comes to know 
                    that Balaji is not a dumb guy and uses him to play their ploy 
                    to get the match with Harbhajan canceled. <br/>
<br/>
                    As the fuming Sikandar is back to 'Punjabi' house, Pooja playfully 
                    falls in love with Balaji. She comes to know about the flashback 
                    of Balaji and sends Rs 10 lacs to his parents as chit funds 
                    amount and she enquires about Sujatha and comes to know that 
                    she is staying in her hubby's house (not knowing that Sujatha 
                    is treating late Balaji as her husband). After coming to know 
                    that Sujatha is married Balaji feels happy for her and plants 
                    Pooja firmly in his heart. <br/>
<br/>
                    Sikandar comes to know about the love that is blossoming between 
                    Balaji and Pooja and decides to get them married after talking 
                    to Penchalayya. Balaji then confesses to everyone that he 
                    is not a dumb guy and elaborates his flash back. <br/>
<br/>
                    Then the parents of Pooja go to the parents of Balaji. When 
                    they inform that Balaji is going to get married to Pooja, 
                    Sujatha disappears from the scene. <br/>
<br/>
                    As we head for an exhilarating climax we have a hero and two 
                    willing heroines vying for him. Who will tie the knot to Balaji 
                    .. Sujatha or Pooja? You gotta watch this beautiful film on 
                    silver screen to find it out!! </font></p>

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Actors:</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Naveen:</b> Naveen did an excellent job. His role does not 
                  have dialogues for the half of the film and in the remaining 
                  half the heroines would not let him speak. Naveen looks very 
                  handsome. <br/>
<b> Maheswari:</b> Kodi knows how to extract the action from 
                  Maheswari. She acted extremely well. As she is playing the role 
                  of dumb girl, she needs to do lot of emoting. Kodi made sure 
                  that only positive aspects of maheswari are projected over the 
                  screen( ala krishna vamsi for gulabi). She looks very sensible 
                  and beautiful. <br/>
<b> Laya:</b> Laya is on the way to conquer the hearts of telugu 
                  viewer from movie to movie. She did an excellent job and looks 
                  very cute with 'rendu jadalu'. <br/>
<b> Shishwa:</b> Sishwa did a very good supporting role for 
                  Maheswari. She is an alter ego to Maheswari in this film. She 
                  did exceedingly well with in her limitations. <br/>
<b> Vinod Kumar:</b> Vinod Kumar looks like a real angry surd 
                  in this film. He did a cameo role in this film. <br/>
<b> Satyanarayana:</b> Satyanarayana fits the bill of sardarji 
                  well. A few surd jokes are shown using him. <br/>
<b> Brahmanandam:</b> Brahmanandam is in his elements. Without 
                  his sensible humor first half of this film would have gone for 
                  a toss. Brahmanandam shows a different dimension to his humor 
                  in the laugh rioting scenes of this film. <b><br/>
<br/>
</b> <b>Direction:</b> The total credit of this film's craftiness 
                  goes to Kodi. He made sure that there is undercurrent humor 
                  is intact behind the dumbness of Balaji. He made sure that maheswari 
                  looks very beautiful. More surprisingly Kodi came up with a 
                  film sans vulgarity. There is no double entendre in this film. 
                  No exposing of heroine in the songs. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Story:</b> This film is a remake of Malayali hit 'Punjabi 
                  House'. This thin story that has to be dealt sensitively <br/>
<br/>
<b> Screenplay:</b> Screenplay of Kodi is slick and telugu nativity 
                  is never missing either in comedy or in sentiment scenes. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Production:</b> Inclusion of Bhargav Reddy into the production 
                  activity seems to have given a new flavor to this Bhargav Arts 
                  film. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Dialogues:</b> There are lot of humorous and a few punch 
                  dialogues. Bhargav arts permanent dialogue writer Ganesh Pathro 
                  did full justice to his Job. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Music:</b> After 'Swayamvaram' Vandemataram Srinivas has 
                  come one with one more melodious album. 'Neeli Gaganamlo' is 
                  the highlight song of the film. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Photography:</b> Though this film is made on a small budget, 
                  there is lot of richness in the film because of the characteristic 
                  photography by SriVenkat. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Choreography:</b> There are two punjabi 'balle balle' family 
                  songs(just like HAHK istyle), one solo song, a superb melodious 
                  romantic song and a sad duet. The Siva-Subramanyam pair did 
                  a commendable job. </font></td>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">S 
                  Gopal Reddy has taken a risk of selecting a story in which heroine 
                  is totally dumb and Hero pretends to be dumb. And this film 
                  comes at the time when another film with hero in a dumb role 
                  'Seenu' is released. But the director made sure that nativity 
                  is not missing. More over hilarious comedy by Brahmanandam makes 
                  us laugh uncontrollably. First half is in lighter vein and second 
                  half is very gripping. Climax is the heart and soul of the film. 
                  Wait a few weeks and you will know the fate of this clean sensible 
                  film.</font></td>
