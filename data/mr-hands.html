<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hyderabad is 
              rocking with bomb blasts and the CBI branch of Hyderabad and AP 
              Police failed to investigate and find the culprit out. Now its the 
              turn of Saraswati (Jayasudha), a CBI officer from Delhi to take 
              up the assignment. As a new officer is coming from Delhi, Giribabu, 
              the Hyderbad head of CBI elects two of the 'good for nothing' fellows 
              to assist Saraswati. Giribabu chosen these two guys, because they 
              are capable of frustrating Saraswati with their brainless work. 
              There by Giribabu can save his skin from the CBI HQ.<br/>
<br/>
              Coming to the two guys on the Mission: Muddu Krishna,Fondly called 
              as Muddu(Nagababu) and Jagan, Gun .... Jagan(Brahmanandam) are close 
              buddies can equally compete with each other in their brains. <br/>
<br/>
              Then there is a Den. There lies a Hindi Villain called Tuglak, who 
              is on a mission to destabilize Hyderabad by planting bombs. All 
              his followers do not know Hindi, Tanikella Bharani is used as a 
              translator to promote (mis)communication. <br/>
<br/>
              As Saraswati takes up the assignment to unveil the real story, Jagan 
              and Muddu spare no effort to fail the mission with their gullibility. 
              It does not take long for Saraswati to understand the capabilities 
              of jagan and Muddu. Still she prefers them as her assistants.<br/>
<br/>
              By looking at the way Saraswati behaves with Jagan and Muddu, our 
              deadly duo comes to a conclusion that she is loving one of them. 
              One day, Jagan finds a suitcase on the road and comes to know about 
              the terrorist's destructive blue print accompanied by the some money. 
              They traces the person to whom this suitcase to be delivered and 
              finds it to be Ramakoti (Kota). That money was sent to Ramakoti 
              from Tuglak, which accidentally lands up into the hands of Jagan. 
              This creates a major misunderstanding between Ramkoti and Tuglak.<br/>
<br/>
              Ramakoti threatens Tuglak that he will surrender to police and becomes 
              an approver, if Tuglak fails to give him money. When the birthday 
              party of Ramkoti is going on, Tuglak gangs injects him poison and 
              kills him. <br/>
<br/>
              This dead body of Ramkoti is used as a pray by Saraswati to entice 
              Tuglak. They make the deadbody of Ramkoti go for morning walk and 
              give a press talk. Tuglak thinks that Ramkoti is alive. As Saraswati 
              is making Ramkoti become an approver, Tuglak frantically tries to 
              kidnap Ramkori. At the same time the close buddies Gajan and Muddu 
              are in neckdeep love with Saraswati. To know what this exciting 
              climax has to offer, one got to watch in on a big silver screen.</font></p>

<td colspan="2">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><br/>
              Artists:</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Jayasudha:</b> Jayasudha is an apt actor for Saraswati character. 
              Her role in this film needs the acumen of an Intelligent officer 
              and the naivety of a common Indian woman. She is as glamorous as 
              ever in those cute business suits. She danced with vigor in a song 
              with indispensable Brahmanandam and inscrutable Nagababu.<br/>
<b>Brahmanandam:</b> This role is a soft one that is underplayed 
              sensibly by Brahmanandam. His flashback episode of marriage is one 
              of the highlight of the film.<br/>
<b></b><b> Nagababu:</b> Nagababu did well with in his limitations. 
              He is given less importance compared to Brahmanandam in this film. 
              But he did well to compliment Brahmanandam in his own style.<br/>
<b>Kota:</b> He acted as a dead body in this film. its pretty difficult 
              for a lively actor like him to stay dumb throughout the film. He 
              just managed that.<br/>
<b>Chiranjeevi:</b> The surprise pack of the film comes as a cameo 
              guest appearance by Chiranjeevi. When the deadly duo chases Tuglak, 
              they land up at a Fashion Mela. Tuglak grabs a guy from behind and 
              threaten Nagababu and Brahmanandam that he will kill that guy. Ultimately 
              the new hostage of Tuglak turns out to be the Megastar. Chiru does 
              some ventriloquism with a pet toy before giving the final punch 
              to Tuglak and there ends the story of 'Handsup'. In the end it is 
              shown that Chiru is the husband of Jayasudha.<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br/>
<b>Other Departments</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Direction:</b> Siva nageswara Rao tried to recreate the magic 
              of 'money'. But the narration has taken a beating which resulted 
              in viewers feel the movie is dragged. But there are a many scenes 
              in this film that demonstrate the class of Sivanageswara Rao at 
              directing slapstick comedy. We can see the taking of Ram Gopal Varma 
              when it come to doing thrilling sequences followed by his own style 
              of lighter vein comedy.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> Music in this film is impressive. Jayasudha is supposed 
              to have taken special interest. There are five songs and three short 
              songs. 'Lahiri Lahiri' song is good. 'Tragedy .. Tragedy' is very 
              good. DTS in this film is strikingly impressive. Choreography by 
              Laurance is pretty good in a song in which he danced with Deepti 
              Bhatnagar.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Dialogues:</b> Janardhan Maharshi written good dialogues for 
              this film. One can see lot of puns in his dialogues.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Production:</b> This film started as small budget film and ended 
              up as a big film. Uttermost care is taken in terms of production 
              and promotion.</font></p>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The USP of this 
              film is comedy. As the story is simple, this film would have worked 
              well if it is taken an hour to narrate. By adding five songs to 
              the wafer-thin story and dragging the story in the second half, 
              the director made this film a little insipid. Yet this film is worth 
              watching just because Jayasudha has given a new flavor to Telugu 
              Cinema by venturing into the untested territory. These sort of experiments 
              should be welcomed by the viewers. This film is recommended for 
              soft comedy lovers as well as Jayasudha and Chiru fans. We have 
              to wait and see how the common Telugu viewer receives this novel 
              film.</font></p>
