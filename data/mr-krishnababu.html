                    Babu (Balakrishna) is the man of jamindar clan in Krishnapuram, 
                    who is considered as the most important man in that village. 
                    Vijay Babu (Abbas) is his brother doing his graduation in 
                    Hyderabad. Chandra Babu (Chandra Mohan) is the maternal uncle 
                    of KrishnaBabu who stays along with him to take care of him. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    Krishnapuram is getting ready to celebrate the festival Ugadi 
                    under the aegis of KrishnaBabu. There is some dance program 
                    and the dance troop is awaited. As the new head master enters 
                    village with his family and his harmony box the servants of 
                    krishna Babu mistakes him to be the dance master and engages 
                    them to their guest house. There you go!! Krishna Babu meets 
                    the sensuous damsel Rama (Meena), the daughter of the new 
                    head master. <br/>
<br/>
                    Sarvarayudu (Ramireddy) is another maternal uncle of KrishnaBabu, 
                    who has a family feud with Krishna Babu. Sarvarayudu has a 
                    daughter, whom he want to get married to KrishnaBabu. But 
                    she is in deep love with their servant Sivaji Raja. KrishnaBabu 
                    takes an instrumental role in getting her married to Sivaji 
                    Raja. <br/>
<br/>
                    Rama and KrishnaBabu fall in love over the period of time. 
                    Meantime Vijay Babu is in love till his neck with his classmate 
                    Shilpa (Raasi) in Hyderabad. Rama and KrishnaBabu are all 
                    set to get engaged to each other. Enter the jailor (Narra), 
                    who interrupts the engagement to reveal that KrishnaBabu is 
                    a murderer and was in jail for his criminal offense. <br/>
<br/>
                    *Then Krishna Babu elaborates his flashback.* <br/>
<br/>
                    KrishnaBabu is the only son of Ranganath and Rajeswari. Ranganath 
                    becomes a flirt and started having a lady as a <i>keep</i> 
                    in his own house. Rajeswari keeps mum and pretends as if she 
                    is sick as she don't want to get the name of Ranganath Spoiled. 
                    Chandrababu is the brother of Rajeswari and Sarvarayudu is 
                    the brother of the <i>keep</i>. Enter the new kid in the block 
                    from Ranganath-<i>Keep</i> combination .... Vijay Babu. <br/>
<br/>
<i> Keep</i> along with Sarvarayudu plans to get rid of Rajeswari 
                    by sending a cup of poison adulterated coffee to Rajeswari 
                    through KrishnaBabu. Ranganath accidentally drinks it and 
                    expires. The blame is put on Krishna Babu as the murderer 
                    and Rajeswari as the conspirator. KrishnaBabu is taken to 
                    police station and Rajeswari dies of heart attack seeing the 
                    death of her husband and plight of her son. <br/>
<br/>
                    Meantime Sarvarayudu murders his own sister and sends Vijay 
                    Babu to the orphanage. KrishnaBabu instructs Chandra Babu 
                    to take good care of Vijay Babu by sending him to city and 
                    giving good education. He makes sure that Vijay Babu believes 
                    that Krishna Babu is his own brother. <br/>
<br/>
                    The kid Krishna Babu is sent to jail and after hibernation 
                    away from society of 14 years, he returns back to his village 
                    to take the reigns of the kindhearted leader of Krishnapuram 
                    by winning the goodwill of village men. <br/>
<br/>
                    *End of the flash back* <br/>
<br/>
                    Everyone sheds tears listening to the sad flashback. Engagement 
                    is over on a happy note. Meantime the ex-warden (Sutti Velu) 
                    of KrishnaBabu comes and meets him. Upon enquiry ex-warden 
                    tells him that he is having a daughter and he saved his 3 
                    lac money in a chit fund jointly owned by his friend for her 
                    marriage. <br/>
<br/>
                    Sarvarayudu is on fire seeing Krishna Babu, who arranged the 
                    marriage between his daughter and the servant, getting engaged 
                    to Rama. He kidnaps Rama. He soils the eyes of KrishnaBabu 
                    who came to rescue Rama. In that process Krishna Babu, whose 
                    vision was temporarily impaired due to soil, murders Rama. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    *Interval* <br/>
<br/>
                    KrishnaBabu is again sent to jail for murdering Rama for 7 
                    years. Sarvarayudu is sent to jail for 3 years for instigating 
                    KrishnaBabu and causing the murder. By this time Vijay Babu 
                    completes his graduation and secures MS admission in USA. 
                    KrishnaBabu asks Vijay Babu to go to states and do MS. <br/>
<br/>
                    When Vijay Babu meets Shilpa, he explains the plight of his 
                    brother and confesses her that he cannot get married to her 
                    for the next 7 years as he wants his brother to get married 
                    first. At the same time Shilpa say that his father might not 
                    allow her to be unmarried for 7 years. Then they arrive at 
                    the practical solution and decides to leave as friends and 
                    to live their own lives forever. <br/>
<br/>
                    For his good conduct in his jail Krishna Babu is released 
                    much earlier than Sarvarayudu. When he is returning home, 
                    Krishna Babu watches his ex-warden being beaten up thoroughly 
                    by the investors as the owner of chit fund fled with their 
                    money. Krishna Babu joins the ex-warden in hospital. Ex-warden 
                    dies of wounds asking Krishna Babu to take care of his daughter 
                    Shilpa. Krishna Babu pays up all the debts of Chit fund company 
                    and takes Shilpa to his house. <br/>
<br/>
                    As Krishna Babu is mentally wrought with the agony of struggles 
                    he is going through, Shilpa makes him the man with the smile 
                    by helping him to regain the composure of a normal man. Village 
                    men starts questioning the relationship between Krishna Babu 
                    and Shilpa. Upon Chandra Babu's request Krishna Babu starts 
                    searching for a suitable guy for Shilpa, only to be questioned 
                    by cynical probable candidates about the relationship between 
                    Shilpa and Krishna Babu. <br/>
<br/>
                    Chandra Babu makes Shilpa and Krishna Babu agree to his proposal 
                    and arranges the marriage of convenience between Krishna Babu 
                    and Shilpa. Krishna Babu arranges his marriage to coincide 
                    with the Vijay Kumar stay in India. Krishna Babu is aware 
                    of the love story going between Vijay Babu and his lover during 
                    his graduation days. <br/>
<br/>
                    Vijay Babu lands up home as Shilpa is getting ready to married 
                    to Krishna Babu in a couple of days. Vijay Babu and Shilpa 
                    gets shocked looking at each other. All the friends of Vijay 
                    Kumar are invited to marriage. Chandra Babu overhears the 
                    conversation between Shilpa and Vijay Babu. <br/>
<br/>
                    As the stage is set for Grand Finale, we are left with a few 
                    unanswered questions? Will Chandra Babu tell the truth to 
                    Krishna Babu? Do any of Vijay Babu and Shilpa scarifies their 
                    life for Krishna Babu? Will the friends of Vijay Babu come 
                    for the marriage and tell Krishna Babu about the college love 
                    between Vijay Babu and Shilpa? We should also notice a fact 
                    that Sarvarayudu is waiting in the wings to take revenge on 
                    Krishna Babu and implicate him for the third time!!!. Will 
                    the hell break loose? <br/>
<br/>
                    To know the right answer to this nail biting climax, on has 
                    to watch this exhilarating film sitting on the edge of the 
                    seats on a silver screen. </font></p>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Actors:</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Balaiah:</b> This role has the undercurrent emotional struggle 
                  and at the same time it has shades of an omnipotent good doer 
                  . Balaiah gave an award winning performance with this film. 
                  He got molded in to the character with Ã©lan. He did the perfect 
                  balance act between expressive soft, yet powerful emotions and 
                  undercurrent psychological burning. He looks slim, very soft 
                  and tender in this film. <br/>
<b> Meena:</b> She is her role with naturality. <br/>
<b> Raasi:</b> She did a role of jolly nature in the first half 
                  and serious nature in the second half. Her character was created 
                  with such a craftiness that she need no do any emoting. The 
                  characters of Balaiah and Chandra Mohan elevates all the scenes 
                  of Raasi in second half. This is a memorable character in her 
                  career graph. <br/>
<b> Chandra Mohan:</b> He deserves a special mention for his 
                  powerful action in this film. As Balaiah character under goes 
                  the active part of the immense struggle, the character of Chandra 
                  Mohan goes through the passive part of emotional struggle of 
                  Balaiah. He got a very important full length role in this film. 
                  And he impresses everyone with his acting prowess. <br/>
<b> Abbas:</b> Of late Abbas seems to be getting roles that 
                  have scope for emoting. He did his bit with precision. <br/>
<b><br/>
                  Direction-Screenplay:</b> The total credit for the smooth execution 
                  of scenes and story narration with slick screenplay goes to 
                  Muthyala Subbaiah. He knows how to show the sentiment in different 
                  films in different ways. This story takes right turns all the 
                  time and springs up a few surprising twists. This sensible story 
                  needs to be handled sensitively and with the right team behind 
                  him he directed this magic film with his hallmark ability. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Story:</b> Producer Chanti gives a very touching story. 
                  Its very heartening to see a original, genuine and powerful 
                  story coming from the Telugu man when most of our people of 
                  hovering on Tamilnadu for stories. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Production:</b> Chanti and Sreenivasa Reddy showed what 
                  a technical producer can do for a film. Each and every frame 
                  in this film looks rich and meaningful. They worked with proper 
                  planning to release this film on the date planned at the start 
                  of film, without losing the quality. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Dialogues:</b> This department needs special commendation. 
                  Its a welcoming change to listen to Madhu soft dialogues uttered 
                  by Balaiah. Madhu gave a perfect balance in the film with his 
                  dialogues. He gave the comedy and sentiment in right proportion 
                  and at the same time he made sure that the on screen powerful 
                  persona of Balaiah is intact. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Music:</b> Listeners were not be pleased with the songs 
                  of this film when the audio was released. But watching it on 
                  screen is a different experience all together. Koti gave a good 
                  music for this film. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Camera:</b> Very good camera work by Sreenivasa Reddy. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Editor:</b> Nice editing by the producer brother V Nagi 
                  Reddy. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Dances:</b> All the steps by Balaiah, Meena and Raasi are 
                  very sensible and of wide variety. Very good choreography by 
                  Laurance, Kala and Tara. Its a treat to watch Balaiah shake 
                  his leg with the Australian blond dames in the back drop of 
                  Opera House and Sky Scrappers of Sydney in 'Sakhi Mast' song.

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                  team of Balaiah - Muthyala - Chanti made sure that they hit 
                  the bulls eye this time. Full credit goes to all these three 
                  people for choosing a sensible story line and sticking to story 
                  than preferring to the towering mass persona of post-SSR Balaiah. 
                  You can see only characters in this film, not artists. There 
                  are a few loopholes in the story and the credit goes to Muthayala 
                  for narrating story in such a fascinating style. This film is 
                  going to do wonders by getting full marks from critics as well 
                  as from box-office. A must see for everyone. Lets see how the 
                  viewers of AP will carve the commercial success of 'Krishna 
                  Babu'.</font></td>
