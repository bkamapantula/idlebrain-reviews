<br/>
                    After graduation, Vasu (Venkatesh) runs a college canteen, 
                    music school and teaches music for seven years to make his 
                    living. His father (Vijay Kumar) is an IPS officer and he 
                    wants Vasu to appear for Civil Services examinations to take 
                    up IPS career. But Vasu has different plans for his future. 
                    He dreams of becoming a musician and a singer. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
                    fine day a young IPS officer comes to Vasu's places to seek 
                    the blessings of Vasu's father. He admits that Vasu's father 
                    is the source of inspiration for him to become an IPS officer. 
                    Vasu's father, dejected that his son does not heed his advice 
                    of giving civils exams, feels bad about his son. Meanwhile, 
                    Vasu spots a beautiful girl Deepti (Bhumika Chawla) on the 
                    street. He plays every possible trick to woo her. But all 
                    his plans backfire on him and make himself a fool in the eyes 
                    of Deepti. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vasu 
                    father spots Vasu bashing the guys up in the streets and asks 
                    him to leave the house and stay outside. Venky leaves the 
                    house. Deepti comes down to Vasu's place along with her luggage 
                    when Vasu was about the leave the house. Later on, Vasu comes 
                    to know that Deepti is the daughter of Vasu's father's childhood 
                    friend. Vasu sees this as an opportunity to get close to Deepti. 
                    He returns to his home and promises that he won't touch music 
                    again and concentrates only on his studies. But Vasu secretly 
                    pursues his music ambitions.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Vasu 
                    passes the preliminary auditions of Music Talent search conducted 
                    by Sony Music Company. When Vasu's father spots the letter 
                    from Sony, he argues with his son and asks him to either be 
                    there in house and study for IPS or leave home to pursue his 
                    dream of becoming a musician. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Deepti 
                    falls in love with Vasu and vice versa. But they never express 
                    their feelings towards each other. Vasu's sister loves the 
                    brother of Deepti and its okayed by the parents of both parties. 
                    It is also revealed that Deepti already Okayed a guy called 
                    Manohar by looking at his photograph (this is much before 
                    she met Vasu).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
                    it's time for the real test. It's D Day. Vasu is on the stage 
                    to prove himself as a singer and musician in the final auditions 
                    of Sony Talent Search. Deepti is getting married to Manohar 
                    on the same day. Vasu's sister is also getting married to 
                    Deepti's brother. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Will 
                    Vasu win the prize at audition and marry Deepti? Watch the 
                    film for yourself if you want to know yourself.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Venkatesh</b>: 
                    Venky performed well in this film. He toned down his body. 
                    But he is not looking good in the get-up of Vasu. There seems 
                    to be something really unpleasant about his get-up. It could 
                    be either the goti or the fat-reduced cheeks. His hogged the 
                    screen all the time. He got 95% percent of screen presence. 
                    </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Bhumika</b>: 
                    She got very less footage in the film. Her screen presence 
                    on the film is just about 20% (excluding song). She did well 
                    within the limitations of her character. Bhumika, as usual, 
                    is looking very pretty in Vasu.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                    Screenplay - Direction</b>: Karunakaran concentrated too much 
                    on the character of hero and did not really expand the role 
                    of heroine, which is very uncharacteristic of him (if we look 
                    the way he beautifully explored the roles of heroines in Toli 
                    Prema and Yuvakudu). That hero orientation for Vasu has robbed 
                    off the family story tag this film. He took so much time to 
                    explain how good is the hero. But when it comes to other characters, 
                    he just managed to introduce them to the minimal effect. This 
                    kind of narration caused lots of confusion in the second half 
                    and it resulted in climax getting totally diluted and left 
                    the viewers in the state of chaos. Karunakaran should better 
                    choose the storyline and stick to it's screenplay rather than 
                    wavering by doing hero-image-building exercises. Viewers are 
                    bound to get disappointed with Karunakaran work.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Trivikram has done a neat job as the dialogue writer in this 
                    film. The comedy dialogues in the first half are good. But 
                    most of the serious dialogues written to Venky go on 'lecture-giving-mode'. 
                    Right dialogue in the right moment gives the bright effect. 
                    But lots of dialogues are misused in the film, as the situation 
                    does not demand that kind of serious dialogues.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music:</b> 
                    Music is one thing that stands out in this film. Songs are 
                    excellent and background music is brilliant. Harris Jayaraj 
                    proved his mettle again with this film as a good music maker. 
                    He also did two brief music bits for Vasu, which are pretty 
                    mellifluous and peppy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    Photography by Ramesh Babu is pretty good. The way he canned 
                    the beautiful sets and exotic locations in the film is commendable.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                    KS Rama Rao has made this film on a lavish scale. The film 
                    looks pretty rich and colorful. He should have taken more 
                    care about the second half and especially climax.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    First half of the film is average. Second half is little boring. 
                    Plus points in the film are songs and comedy. Climax is the 
                    main drawback. This film has got the best of the cast and 
                    crew - Venkatesh, Bhumika Chawla, KS Rama Rao, Karunakaran, 
                    Trivikram Srinivas and Karunakaran. If you examine individual 
                    scenes, they are excellent. But the soul of the film is missing. 
                    One does not understand why this film is captioned with 'The 
                    Voice of Youth'. The caption for the film is totally unjustified. 
                    The classes might find this film to be OK. But masses may 
                    not hog on to Vasu.</font></p>
