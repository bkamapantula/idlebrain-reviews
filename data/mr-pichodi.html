<td colspan="2">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maharadhi 
                    (Capt. Raju) is the chief editor of the best circulated news 
                    paper of AP, 'Prajaswamyam'. Chakradhara Rao (Charan Raj) 
                    is the CM of AP. Brahmaji and Indraja are committed journalists 
                    of 'Prajaswamyam'. Adiseshagiri Rao (Suthi Velu) and his companions 
                    are freedom fighters who are dedicated for the cause of curing 
                    the political system and doing the social justice. <br/>
<br/>
                    Maharadhi is instrumental in projecting Chakradhar Rao as 
                    the force to reckon with by using his 'prajaswamyam'. In a 
                    way, Maharadhi remote controls the government headed by Chakradhara 
                    Rao by enforcing the opinions of his news paper on the policies 
                    of Government. <br/>
<br/>
                    Veera Reddy is the publisher of another popular news paper 
                    and is the main rival of Maharadhi. In the recent allocations 
                    of Liquor permits, Veera Reddy gets license to manufacture 
                    IMFL (Indian Made Foreign Liquor). Maharadhi gets irritated 
                    by this and ploys a strategy. In the next day's main editorial 
                    Maharadhi writes about the plight of the people getting effected 
                    by Liquor and then opens the pandora Box. Next day, it turns 
                    out to be the voice of the people. Adiseshagiri Rao and his 
                    companions starts their 'udyamam' on banning liquor. Finally 
                    government is forced to ban liquor. <br/>
<br/>
                    Once the liquor is banned, all the leaders who are in power 
                    starts minting money by smuggling liquor and making adulterated 
                    liquor. And immediately the same issue is focussed by 'Prajaswamyam' 
                    news paper editorial. Another 'udyamam' is started by women 
                    seeking the removal of ban on liquor. As the women starts 
                    thronging the gates of CM's office, CM verbally assaults the 
                    DIG of police for their inefficiency saying that they failed 
                    in implementing the ban of liquor (That sincere officer dies 
                    of heart attack later, that's different issue). Then he assures 
                    all the women that he is lifting the ban on liquor with affect 
                    from that minute. Most of the new liquor licenses will be 
                    given to the relatives of Maharadhi. <br/>
<br/>
                    As the state of the state is in ruckus caused by the removal 
                    of ban on liquor, Maharadhi has to divert the attention of 
                    janatha by giving some sensational headlines. The same day 
                    'Prajaswamyam' comes up with a sensational main page article 
                    saying 'Sri Krishna Devaraya is still alive'. AVS is the professor 
                    who firmly believes that 'Sri Krishna Deva Raya' still alive. 
                    As they start exploring all antique places, they find a coffin 
                    with fumes coming out. When they open it they find a short 
                    smiling man (Chandra Mohan) in royal dress. Upon enquiring 
                    he admits that he is 'Tenali Rama Lingadu'(TRL). He also informs 
                    about the spot at which Sri Krishna Devaraya's(SDK) coffin 
                    is lying. Upon digging that place they see Sri Krishna Devaraya 
                    (Dasari) having an angelic sleep. Upon enquiry they reveal 
                    that they have taken a few herbal medicines which will make 
                    them alive for 500 years. <br/>
<br/>
                    Maharadhi and CM are surprised as they have no clue about 
                    how these two ancestors come to the scene. Slowly SKD get 
                    prominence among the people. adisesha Giri Rao and friends 
                    forms a party chooses SKD to be their leader. Center announces 
                    the polls a six months ahead than expected. Immediately 'Prajaswamyam' 
                    does the poll survey. Brahmaji gives the survey results to 
                    Maharadhi that shows 60% vote for SKD and 14% vote for Chakra 
                    Dhara Rao. Maharadhi simply changes the equation and publishes 
                    the poll results in 'Prajaswamyam' that Chakra Dhara Rao has 
                    60% vote share and SKD has 14%. <br/>
<br/>
                    At the same time Maharadhi warns CM to be cautious about his 
                    public image and asks him to introduce pro poor schemes and 
                    do transfer all the sincere officers to insignificant positions. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    Elections are held and SKD party wins the elections by huge 
                    majority. As the SKD's oath taking takes place as a CM, he 
                    springs everyone by surprise by inviting all the Chakra Dhara 
                    Rao's corrupted men as ministers. The man who is in utter 
                    shock is Tenali Ramalingadu. He asks him why SKD has become 
                    like this for which SKD gives an unsatisfactory answer. Then 
                    TL challenges that he will prove to the people that SKD is 
                    none but 'Devanna', a dreaded naxal who is supposed to have 
                    died in an encounter. <br/>
<br/>
                    *Interval* <br/>
<br/>
                    SKD starts robbing the whole state by taking bribes as and 
                    when he gets a chance. Chakra Dhara Rao is the only person 
                    left in the insignificant opposition. He too wants to join 
                    SKD party. SKD invites him and makes him the chairman to planning 
                    committee. Then the most innovative ideas start floating like 
                    giving loans to the private bus owners and hire those buses 
                    for APSRTC transportation and receive all the kickbacks. Mean 
                    time Tenali Ramalingadu is put up in mental asylum by SKD 
                    so that he could not reveal the truth about them. <br/>
<br/>
                    SKD succeeds in creating tussle of misinterpretation between 
                    and chakradhara Rao and maharadhi. After realizing the double 
                    play by SKD, Maharadhi calls chakra dhara Rao and explains 
                    him who SKD is. SKD is none but the most dreaded naxal leader 
                    Devanna, who is supposed have have died in one of the encounters. 
                    He along with Chandra mohan uses the trick played by Maharadhi 
                    and enter politics as SKD. <br/>
<br/>
                    When Maharadhi reveals this truth to the whole nation, all 
                    the people go berserk for the emotional cheating done by SKD. 
                    SKD plays the most popular trick of politicians by fleeing 
                    to abroad. When SKD comes back from abroad a bid on his life 
                    is made which SKD escapes narrowly. <br/>
<br/>
                    As the climax is set for the film, Devanna(SKD) chooses TV 
                    to address the state. He explains that he entered politics 
                    with noble intentions, but due to the blackmail by Maharadhi, 
                    he had to change his path. He started taking bribes and collected 
                    huge amount. He then fled to abroad to pay back all the loans 
                    taken by chakra dhara rao(for developing AP) to free of debts 
                    to AP(he says each and every person in Andhra Pradesh owe 
                    Rs 6,000 to the world bank). This film ends with a message 
                    that the vote should not become 'pichivadi chetilo raayi'.
