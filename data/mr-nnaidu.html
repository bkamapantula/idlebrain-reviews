                    There are two neighboring villages in Rayalaseema. Goons head 
                    one village and Raghupati Naidu (K Vishwanath) is heading 
                    another village. As Raghupati Naidu is peace loving, his village 
                    is dogged by the misdeeds of goons from the neighboring village. 
                    In order to save the future of his village, Raghupati Naidu 
                    asks one male kid from each family to be given for the purpose 
                    of saving the village. Raghupati Naidu selected his fourth 
                    son Narasimha Naidu as his family's contribution towards the 
                    security of the village. All these kids will be trained and 
                    prepared to protect the village. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    15 years.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anjali 
                    (Preethi Jingyani) is the niece of Jaya Prakash, who happens 
                    to be one of the goons from the goons' village who later settled 
                    in another village. Narasimha Naidu sets up a naatya ashram 
                    to teach classical dance to the students. Anjali falls in 
                    love with Narasimha Naidu at the first sight. Anjali joins 
                    Narasimha Naidu as the student and tries to make Narasimha 
                    Naidu fall in love with her. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later 
                    on, she comes to know that Narasimha Naidu is already married 
                    and he has a kid too who is growing in the ashram. Narasimha 
                    Naidu is a widower as his wife Sravanthi (Simran) is no more. 
                    Anjali tries to get closer to the kid so that she can then 
                    marry Narasimha Naidu.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    parents of Anjali fix up the marriage of Anjali with one of 
                    their relatives. When the uncle of Anjali comes to know that 
                    she is in love with a widowed dance master; he attacks him 
                    and threatens him that he would kill the kid. When they find 
                    Anjali missing, the entire battalion of goons invades the 
                    ashram of dance master only to find that he flew away. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Narasimha 
                    Naidu, after coming to know that goons were coming to attack 
                    him, vacates the ashram and boards the train. At the same 
                    time Anjali too boards the train, though Narasimha Naidu rejects 
                    it. Then a fleet 16 Whites Sumos containing goons chases the 
                    train using a parallel road. And they over take train and 
                    stop it forcibly at a station. Then we have around 100-armed 
                    goons surrounding the train and vying for the blood of Narasimha 
                    Naidu. After a couple of minutes Narasimha Naidu gets down 
                    the train showing his back to them. And then turns around. 
                    The moment, the goons realize that the dance master is none 
                    but Narasimha Naidu; they leave all their arms and run away 
                    to save their dear lives. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then 
                    Narasimha Naidu explains Anjali his flash back.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">*flashback

                    Raghupati Naidu realizes that no parents in the village is 
                    willing to marry off their daughter to Narasimha Naidu since 
                    he is meant for sacrificing for the safety of village. At 
                    that point of time Raghupati Naidu selects a beautiful girl 
                    called Sravanti for his son. But Sravanti is too sensitive 
                    and hates anything to do with violence. Hence Raghupati Naidu 
                    asks Narasimha Naidu to act as a soft guy who has liking for 
                    classical dance. After marriage Sravanti realizes the fact 
                    and decides to live with it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Narasimha 
                    Naidu's three elder brothers arrive along with their families. 
                    Narasimha Naidu has lot of love and adulation for his brothers 
                    where as they treat him very bad which Narasimha Naidu takes 
                    in good sense. After a few days Sravanthi blasts at those 
                    guys who are making mockery of Narasimha Naidu. Then they 
                    complain about Sravanti to Narasimha Naidu. Being upset about 
                    this, Narasimha Naidu sends Sravanti to her parents place. 
                    At her parents place, Sravanthi gives birth to a kid. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    brothers of Narasimha Naidu are still upset with the insult 
                    that is made to them by Sravanthi and decides to leave back 
                    to the states. They arrange for the police security and refuses 
                    Narasimha Naidu to accompany them. During this period, the 
                    goons plan to kill on the brothers of Narasimha Naidu one 
                    end and son and wife of Narasimha Naidu on the other end.<br/>

                    Would Narasimha Naidu marry Anjali? Will he kill the main 
                    villain (the father of Sravanthi)? To know the answers to 
                    these daunting questions, you should watch this film on the 
                    giant screen.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Performances</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Balayya</b>: 
                    The role of Narasimha Naidu has two shades. One aspect is 
                    naiveness and other one is braveness. Balayya came up with 
                    a thundering performance again. He had a few very good dialogues 
                    in this film. In the second half songs, he imitated the antics 
                    of Govinda and impressed the audience with his variety steps. 
                    He too did lot of classical dance in this film (not in the 
                    songs through). He is simply stunning in his Rayalaseema attire 
                    get-up and reminds us of Samarasimha Reddy in many scenes. 
                    </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Simran</b>: 
                    Simran is given a role that is very similar to that of her 
                    role in Nuvvu Vastavani. She would be wearing a plain sari 
                    through out the film except for the songs where she looked 
                    pretty glamorous. Simran has screen presence only in the second 
                    half.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Preethi</b>: 
                    Her appearance in this film starts with a scene in which oil 
                    is poured in her navel. Though her intro started this way, 
                    her act and behavior is decent and admirable throughout the 
                    film. Preethi has good amount of footage in the first half 
                    and has virtually no footage in the second half.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Asha 
                    Saini</b>: Asha Saini played the role of Simran sister and 
                    she is the carrier of the information from one heroine (Simran 
                    in the flashback) to another (Preethi of the present) and 
                    did have a few pranks to play with Balayya for which she has 
                    done fabulous work.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>K 
                    Vishwanath</b>: He is as good as his role. His role did not 
                    have any provision for K Vishwanath to exhilarate. His character 
                    is of less importance in this film after Balayya grows up 
                    as full-fledged Narasimha Naidu.</font></p>

                    Depts</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<b>Story &amp; Screenplay</b>: Chinni Krishna has given the 
                    story and screenplay. First half of the film is interesting 
                    and the peak of inquisitiveness for the viewer goes to the 
                    peak by interval. But in the second half the story is dragged 
                    after the introduction of Narasimha Naidu's brothers and they 
                    exploiting Narasimha Naidu. Screenplay of the film is good 
                    in the fights and chase scenes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Direction</b>: 
                    B Gopal did his act in his style by putting ample amount of 
                    violent action, loads of sentiment. The train-chasing scene 
                    before the interval is highlight of the film and B Gopal made 
                    sure that his mark is left in all the scenes.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Paruchuri and Balayya is the best combination and they lived 
                    up to the expectations with their dialogues.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Songs 
                    &amp; Dances</b>: All songs are good for the listening. But 
                    on the screen, the songs in the first half are not as good 
                    as we listen to them. In the second half all the songs are 
                    superb. Another reason for the second half turned out to be 
                    very good is that all songs have Simran and this pair jells 
                    well in steps</font></p>

                      6</b>: Ninna Kuttesinadi: Another song on Balayya and Simran.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    First half of the film is very good with interval being the 
                    nerve wrecking point. But the second half fail to meet the 
                    expectations created in first half. The episode of Balayya 
                    being exploited by his brothers could have been trimmed. This 
                    may not be as good as Samarasimha Reddy. But it's definitely 
                    better than Goppinti Alludu. Balayya, who amazed every one 
                    with the collections of Samarasimha Reddy, may just repeat 
                    the trick. It all depends on how the masses embrace this film 
                    and how the other Jan and Feb releases are going to fare. 
                    For the starters, Narasimha Naidu film started with a different 
                    story given by Posani Krishna Murali with Balayya playing 
                    the cop and the movie was stopped to accommodate news script. 
                    Looks like it worked.</font></p>
