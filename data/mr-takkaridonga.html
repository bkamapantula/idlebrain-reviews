                    Movie starts off with Shaka (Rahul Dev) killing his own brother 
                    for particular information, which is also known to another 
                    man Veeru Dada. In the encounter Veeru Dada (Ashok Kumar) 
                    jumps off into a river from a cliff. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                    18 years, we have Veeru Dada with a leg cut off giving info 
                    to Raja (Mahesh Babu), a mischievous thief who robs off the 
                    money from banks in a style. Raja gives Veeru Dada a share 
                    of 50% for all his tip offs. Raja becomes more daring as the 
                    price tag on his head increases by thousands.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                    is another mischievous thief Panasa (Bipasha Basu) along with 
                    uncle follows Raju so that she can dupe him and escape with 
                    all the looted money of Raja. As the things go on a frolicking 
                    way between Panasa and Raja, the desperate Shaka is searching 
                    for Veeru Dada in all the places. Veeru Dada realizes that 
                    Shaka would kill him soon. Hence, Veeru Dada offers a big 
                    diamond to Raja and asks him to escort her daughter Bhuvana 
                    (Lisa Ray) to his brother Dharma's place. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    journey starts here. We have the couple going to a remove 
                    village on horses. Panasa and her uncle are following the 
                    lead pair. The bank managers too are desperately trying to 
                    catch Raja. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
                    Shaka wants from Veeru Dada? Who is Raja? What will happen 
                    to Panasa? You must watch this technically extraordinary visual 
                    and aural feast on a big screen with DTS effect.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists: 
                    </b> </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mahesh 
                    Babu</b>: Mahesh Babu suited the cowboy role very well. All 
                    the histrionics of Mahesh Babu are very stylish, yet not loud. 
                    In this film too, he proved to be the director's delight when 
                    it come to executing his part of scenes the way they have 
                    to be done. He took a great risk in few of the action scenes. 
                    On the screen, he should be complimented for the subtle, yet 
                    perfect, emoting. Off the screen, he must be commended for 
                    possessing the kind of GUTS in doing such a role of cowboy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lisa 
                    Ray</b>: People might have some doubts about the Lisa Ray 
                    age etc. But the director has taken enough care to highlight 
                    all the positive aspects of Lisa Ray. She suited well as Mahesh 
                    Babu's girl. Dubbing done by the popular Savita Reddy add 
                    some more freshness and lovability to her character. She is 
                    extremely sensuous and yet innocent looking.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Bipasha 
                    Basu</b>: Bipasha Basu did a sweet role, which is relatively 
                    short. Her dusky looks and demure performance will strike 
                    the right cords in the hearts of audiences.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ashok 
                    Kumar</b>: The lanky Ashok Kumar has acted as Veeru Dada. 
                    His height and the beard suited the role well.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Shaka</b>: 
                    Rahul Dev looks very dangerous in this film. The dialogues 
                    given to him are less and it helped the movie, as his screen 
                    presence is enough to guess the trouble looming on the scenes 
                    in story.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Technical Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                    Screenplay - Direction</b>: Jayant has done an excellent work 
                    as director for this film. Lots of shots in this film are 
                    brilliant. You cannot find this kind of narration in any Indian 
                    films. With this film, Jayant joins the list of Ramu, Krishna 
                    Vamsi and Teja in terms of showing technical finesse in shot 
                    making. Jayant has directed soft love stories in his last 
                    four ventures. Due to that, he did not have the opportunity 
                    to play with the techniques and prove himself as the director 
                    with great-technical-shot-making ability. The entire film 
                    has a light cowboy color theme (just like the hue Aamir used 
                    for Lagaan). Screenplay of the film is sensitive and effective. 
                    But he could have considered narrating the film at a fast 
                    pace. The way he introduced each and every characters is exceptionally 
                    good. He took his time to establish all the lead characters. 
                    And then he slowly unveiled the mystery and the connection 
                    among the lead characters in a systematic way. 'Takkari Donga' 
                    is another director's special film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Story 
                    - Dialogues</b>: Story of the film is very simple and short. 
                    And it depends on the maturity level of audience to conceive 
                    when the story has started. The movie starts with Shaka gunning 
                    for Veeru Dada. This shot does not reveal what the connection 
                    is between Shaka and Veeru dada. The story builds there and 
                    continued till the end. The dialogues are short and scrisp, 
                    especially the ones written for Mahesh Babu.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Thrills 
                    &amp; Action</b>: Vijayan has done excellent job in composing 
                    fights and action scene. These fights are not loud ones like 
                    hero putting ferocious face kicking villains with a fist. 
                    All the fights are risky ones, which appears as if they are 
                    done so naturally.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    The main highlight of the film is extraordinary photography. 
                    Jayanan Vincent has done one of his best works for this film. 
                    The way camera moves in the few shots and the aerial sequences 
                    shot in USA are simply mind-blowing. This film is a real treat 
                    for your eyes if you watch on 70mm screen.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Songs</b>: 
                    All the songs in this film are very good. The introduction 
                    song is ultimate. Again, the dances are sensible and of class 
                    nature. The second best is the melodious song 'Bagundamma 
                    Bagundi'. Hey Mama song stands as the third best followed 
                    by Chukkallo Chandrude and Aleba Aleba </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                    Mani Sharma has given his best work for Takkari Donga. The 
                    music suited the sensibility and the mood of the film. The 
                    way, he used guitar for the background music is praiseworthy. 
                    Background music is extraordinary and music for songs is excellent.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Editing</b>: 
                    Editing of the film is good. Though the film is shot in various 
                    locations in India and abroad, the editing work covers it 
                    up and shows the continuity and uniformity in the narration.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                    Each and every penny spent on the film is visible on the screen. 
                    For the first timers, this is very efficient job. Vasant and 
                    Sumanth must be appreciated for making a risky venture like 
                    Takkari Donga!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    Takkari Donga is a sweet and sensible film. If you are the 
                    kind of a guy who whistles when hero ferociously utters a 
                    dialogue and laughs loudly when a crude joke is cracked, this 
                    is not the film for you to watch. 'Underplay' is the right 
                    word for all the key aspects of the film. The only drawback 
                    of the film is slower narration and length of the movie. A 
                    Cowboy film, which belongs to Hollywood, is made for 1 and 
                    half hours. By making a film for 2 hours and 45 minutes will 
                    have some sluggishness in the narration. <b><i>Takkari Donga 
                    is a true 'pop corn entertainment' film, which you are supposed 
                    to watch in a relaxed manner in a DTS theater without having 
                    any expectations or preconceived opinions in your mind.</i></b> 
                    Takkari Donga is a real class film. The commercial success 
                    of the film depends on how masses embrace this class cowboy 
                    genre film. A cowboy film in Andhra would not have become 
                    a reality in the years to come as Prema and Seema films are 
                    ruling the trend, if Mahesh-Jayant combination were not there. 
                    Kudos to these two people for taking up such a huge risk.
