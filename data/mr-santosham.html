<br/>
                    Karthik (Nagarjuna) is a well-placed architect in Ooty. He 
                    falls in love with Padmavathi (Gracy Singh), an IT intern. 
                    Padmavathi takes her own sweet time to accept Karthik's love. 
                    Padmavathi has a cute cousin sister Bhanu (Sreya). Bhanu encourages 
                    their love and gives courage to Padmavathi. When Padmavathi 
                    reveals about her love, her father Rama Chandraiah (K Viswanath) 
                    resists and asks her to marry the guy he has chosen for her. 
                    Padmavathi flees from home and marries Karthik. Padmavathi 
                    is very eager to get back to her parents and get their blessings. 
                    But Rama Chandraiah keeps them at bay. Karthik and Padmavathi 
                    migrate to New Zealand and they give birth to a kid named 
                    Lucky. Padmavathi dies in an accident.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rama 
                    Chandraiah has a very big joint family. A few of the family 
                    members opine that inviting Karthik and his kid for a marriage 
                    to be happened at their place would give an opportunity to 
                    get a closer look at Lucky, the kid of Padmavathi. When Karthik 
                    visits Rama Chandraiah's place he gets mixed responses from 
                    different people in the house. Rama Chandraiah doesn't like 
                    Karthik and others like him. Over a period of time, Karthik 
                    impresses them all and when he was about to go back to New 
                    Zealand, Rama Chandraiah expresses his repentance for whatever 
                    happened and says that he is accepting Karthik as his son-in-law.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bhanu 
                    has fallen in love with Karthik at first sight way back when 
                    she went to meet Padmavathi at Ooty. At that time she was 
                    not aware that Karthik was the same guy with whom Padmavathi 
                    was in love. She meets Karthik, a widower now. She continues 
                    having feelings for him. But at the same time, there is Pawan 
                    (Prabhu Deva) - a childhood fiend of Bhanu - who is deeply 
                    in love with her.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Karthik 
                    returns back to New Zealand. Bhanu along with Pawan visits 
                    Karthik. They were there to write MS examinations. During 
                    that period Bhanu gets closer to Karthik. When Karthik realizes 
                    the intentions of Bhanu, he fixes Pawan as the fiancée 
                    for her.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
                    Bhanu is about to get married to Pawan. Karthik loves Bhanu, 
                    but is hesitating to repeat the history by marrying a girl 
                    against the wishes of family. Will they get united? You should 
                    watch this film on big silver screen to know yourself.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Nagarjuna</b>: 
                    Nagarjuna is as charming as ever. He suited the role of father 
                    and as the man in love perfectly. He wore black and white 
                    suits in this film and he looks very dignified in that get 
                    up. This role has given him ample scope for exhibiting histrionics 
                    and he made maximum use of it to impress upon one and all.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Gracy 
                    Singh</b>: This is the first colorful film of Gracy Singh 
                    (Lagaan had a shade of gray). But she is not as glamorous 
                    as we expected her after seeing Lagaan. Her role is limited 
                    to 45 minutes in this film. She did justice in displaying 
                    right kind of emotions on her part.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sreya 
                    (Sriya)</b>: Sreya got the major share of the pie. She is 
                    very cute and did the role of Bhanu with élan. Her 
                    vivacious attitude and chirpy outlook added the necessary 
                    luster to her character. She is a treat to watch.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b> 
                    Screenplay - direction</b>: Screenplay of the film is very 
                    good. Direction is also very commendable. Dasarath has got 
                    good narration skills. The best thing about him is that he 
                    did not try to follow the trend. He chosen his subject and 
                    narrated it in his own style. This film oozes positive attitude. 
                    All scenes flow naturally and none them look forced. But he 
                    is slow in his narration, which might make masses squirm a 
                    little bit.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Dialogues in this film are very apt. No forced comic punch 
                    (except for a few scenes involving Sunil)! But Dasarath provided 
                    the right dialogues for the right scenes. A dialogue is worth 
                    mentioning here. It is '<i>preminchadaaniki rendu manasulu 
                    chalu - kaani pelli chsukovadaaniki rendu kutumbalu kavali</i>' 
                    (while telling Sreya that he likes her .. but he does not 
                    want to disturb the equilibrium in the family of Rama Chandraiah).</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music:</b> 
                    The best thing about this film is it's sweet music. RP Patnaik 
                    intelligently mixed the tunes into background music. Whenever 
                    you sense the augur of boredom, you find RP's background music 
                    uplifting the spirit.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Song: 
                    All the songs in the film flow naturally according to the 
                    storyline except for Mehabooba song. All these 7 songs are 
                    situational songs. Here is the sequence and placement - </font></p>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i><b>Emayyindo

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><i>So 
                      much to say that I love you</i></b>: When Gracy rejects 
                      Nag love.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i><b>Devudu 
                      Digi Vachina</b></i>: This song is pictured on Sreya, Nag 
                      and Gracy. This song follows when Sreya unites Nag and Gracy.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i><b>Nuvvunate 
                      Naakistamani</b></i>: This song is on Gracy and Nag. It 
                      starts with the marriage of Gracy and Nag and ends with 
                      them giving birth to Lucky.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i><b>Dhim

                      house, which start immediately after Nag finishes his flashback</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i><b>Mehabooba</b></i>: 
                      A special song on Prabhudeva and Sophia Haq.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <i><b>Ne 
                      Toli Sariga</b></i>: This is the highlight song of the film. 
                      This song is cut into three pieces and is played between 
                      Nag and Sreya before climax<br/>
</font> </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    S Gopal Reddy has done a fine job, as usual, for this film 
                    by canning the picturesque locales of Ooty and New Zealand.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                    KL Narayana produced this film very lavishly. This banner 
                    is called as a lucky banner in the industry. And he might 
                    again prove lucky with this film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    First half of the film is entertaining. The beginning of second 
                    half is little boring. But the director got the audiences 
                    back into his grip half an hour before climax. Heart-rendering 
                    climax is a plus point of the film. The strength of the film 
                    is music (RP Patnaik), hero (Nagarjuna) and cool n composed 
                    direction (Dasarath). Weakness of the film is slow narration. 
                    As the director told in a press meet, this film oozes positive 
                    attitude. Hence, you will not come across any negative comments 
                    about the film. It is a good film to watch!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Trade 
                    Talk</b>: This film has got 10 weeks to 100 days talk depending 
                    on the centers. Since, the box office works on the theory 
                    of the relativity, Santosham's full run is dependant on how 
                    other films that are releasing in the next 30 days (<i>Allari, 
                    Sreeram, Adrustam, Tappuchesi Pappu Koodu</i> and <i>Jayam</i>)
