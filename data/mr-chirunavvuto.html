<br/>
                    Venu (Venu) is an orphan, who is brought up by his mama (Chandra 
                    Mohan). Venu's mama wants to marry him off with his daughter 
                    Aruna (Prema). But during the marriage, Aruna runs away from 
                    her home quoting that Venu's qualification of cookery expert 
                    is not suitable for her. She preferred a better life by eloping 
                    with a rich guy with good educational qualification. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Venu, 
                    whose philosophy is to live happily with smile all the time, 
                    does not take this issue seriously as he has a matured head. 
                    Now Venu goes to the city to find a job by staying at a friend 
                    place. There he meets Sandhya (Shaheen), who is another happy-go-lucky 
                    girl. During a party night, her soft drinks glass was adulterated 
                    with alcohol and she was about to be raped by goons. Then 
                    Venu makes a heroic act by saving the heroine by bashing the 
                    goons. A happy and inebriated Sandhya plants a kiss on the 
                    cheeks of Venu as a token appreciation.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 
                    a period of time Sandhya becomes pretty close to Venu and 
                    both of them are fond of each other. During the birthday bash 
                    of Sandhya, she announces that she is going to get married 
                    soon and introduces Pratap (Prakash Raj) as her fiancée. 
                    Venu, who assumed that she was marrying him, did get upset 
                    and feels that she cheated him. When asked about his disappointment, 
                    Venu tells Sandhya that he loves her for which she says sorry.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Even 
                    after the engagement ceremony of Sandhya and Pratap, Venu 
                    believes that Sandhya still loves him, but she is not in a 
                    position to know her heart. Venu pursues his quest for the 
                    love of Sandhya. Meantime, Sandhya observes the characters 
                    of selfish Pratap and smile-always Venu. Though she realizes 
                    the selfishness and cheating attitude of Pratap, she still 
                    sticks to Pratap and prefers him. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 
                    this time the director increases the tempo of audience wanting 
                    to Sandhya to know her heart and go for Venu. Meantime, Venu 
                    gets a call from a police station that his sister-in-law Aruna 
                    is stationed there. The police grabbed her when she tried 
                    going for a suicide on necklace road. Her lover cheated Aruna 
                    after elopement and they did not have any physical interaction. 
                    Venu gets back her to his home and heals her off all her emotional 
                    wounds. Sandhya, who observes the entire episode from a close 
                    distance, becomes a biggest admirer of Venu. She feels that 
                    Venu is the best friend of her. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just 
                    a day prior to her marriage, Sandhya, who caught in the jinx, 
                    asks her mother about her definition of love. Her mother gives 
                    the golden words of love saying 'Its better to marry a person 
                    who loves you than marrying a person whom you love'. Those 
                    words change the mind and heart of Sandhya and she decides 
                    to get back to Venu and dump Pratap. When she expresses the 
                    same to her father, he ridicules her letting him know just 
                    before marriage and asks her to marry Pratap at any cost. 
                    </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
                    Sandhya turns a runaway bride and goes to Venu's house with 
                    marriage costumes. But Venu, who has his own attitude and 
                    wisdom, refuses to marry her and forces her in getting her 
                    back to the kalyan mandap where she is supposed to tie knot 
                    to Pratap.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here 
                    is the scene poised for the climax! Venu loves Sandhya. Sandhya 
                    Loves Venu too. Aruna, who eloped from the marriage hall, 
                    is back with Venu. The one who eloped with Aruna is none but 
                    Pratap. At the same time, Venu does not tell Sandhya that 
                    Pratap is the culprit. Will Venu marry Sandhya or he gets 
                    back to Aruna and marry her? So many questions would be answered 
                    by a sweet climax only if you watch this film on a silver 
                    screen. It's worth all the money you spent!</font></p>
<p align="justify">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Performances</b></font>
</p>
<p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Venu</b>: 
                    Venu played a role that is close to his heart, just like that 
                    one in Swayamvaram. He did not act in this film. He just gave 
                    expressions. He helped his role gets right kind of projection, 
                    as he is not handsome. At the same time he projected unmatched 
                    attitude through his role. Venu is slowly carving a niche 
                    for himself as hero in Telugu movie market.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Shaheen</b>: 
                    Shaheen, another fair skinned import from North, did display 
                    her charms along with doing some fine acting. She had a dream 
                    role in this film. A bright aspect of the heroine in this 
                    film is the way she was projected with different costumes 
                    and different hairstyles for this film. She had around 4 types 
                    of hairstyles for each song and none of the hairstyles is 
                    repeated. That's the reason why she looks different in each 
                    and every song, which has become another crowd pulling factor 
                    for the youth to watch the film for the second time.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Prakash 
                    Raj</b>: He did a character of his kind in this film, which 
                    is full of selfishness and vices. But the comedy touch of 
                    his role is intact. </font></p>

<p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay 
                    &amp; direction:</b> Ram Prasad is another young director 
                    that belongs to the genre of Vijay Bhaskar and Karunakaran. 
                    There is freshness throughout the film and the way he projected 
                    the inscrutable character of Venu is simply amazing. It's 
                    a popular technique to mask the behavior and think process 
                    of the main complex character and narrating the story through 
                    the other character's angle. And Ram Prasad mastered that 
                    technique and shown the Venu's character as unpredictable 
                    yet sweet character.<br/>

<b>Story&amp; Dialogues</b></font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>:</b> 
                    Trivikram should get equal credit for the success of the film. 
                    Without the dialogues of Trivikram, this film would have been 
                    very dry. He is equally good at writing thought provoking 
                    as well as casual dialogues. No wonder all the three films 
                    he worked for in 2000, Ninne Premista, Nuvve Kavali and Chiru 
                    Navvutho has become blockbusters. He is also writing dialogues 
                    for Venky's 'Nuvvu Naaku Nachav'. He is slowly turning out 
                    to be dependable person, whose presence can change the fate 
                    of the film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Choreography</b>: 
                    Though the music is of average taste, it is the scintillating 
                    choreography and cute cinematography that made all the songs 
                    worth a watch. And the foreign locates add to the luster too.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                    SP Entertainments that is formed by the college time friend 
                    of hero Venu have repeated the magic of 'Swayam Varam' in 
                    a magnified scale.</font> </p>
<p align="justify"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis:</b> 
                    Treatment and the dialogues are the highlights of this film. 
                    When you cast a new hero, its very easy to make the viewers 
                    involved with the character and fall in love with it. The 
                    same thing happened with Chiru Navvuto too. By taking a two 
                    film old as hero and another debutant as heroine, the producers 
                    have introduced another brilliant director Ram Prasad. Ram 
                    Prasad is directing a film with Balayya now. The earlier director 
                    introduced by SP entertainments, Vijaya Bhaskar has delivered 
                    Nuvve Kavali. Just like any other good movie, this film too 
                    picked up by the word of mouth by the satisfied viewers and 
                    went on to become a big hit in the turbulent time of Telugu 
                    cinema.</font></p>
