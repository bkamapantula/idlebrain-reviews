<br/>
                    Way back in 1800's a Jamindar insults Durga Devi by try stealing 
                    her idol in the temple in a state of inebriation. An enraged 
                    Devi kills him and put a curse on his heirs that she is going 
                    to take one family member each every 48 years. And one male 
                    heir dies accidentally at the end of every 48 years. And the 
                    present year denotes end of another 48 years and the Target 
                    of Devi is none but our own Murari.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Murari 
                    is the Grandson of Sabari, whose husband died 48 years back 
                    because of the curse. She named her grandson with her hubby 
                    name Murari. Hence is called with utmost respect by all family 
                    members as '<i>garu</i>' and '<i>andi</i>'. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                    another villages, there lives a beautiful city-bred belle 
                    called Vasundhara. She too lives with a big combined family 
                    and she is the cynosure of all eyes and affection in the family.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Both 
                    the families of Murari and Vasundhara are releated by blood, 
                    but separated due to the family feuds caused by the crooked 
                    villain Rambabu. Every year, Gopamma is allowed to go her 
                    parent's house without any escort from her husband. In the 
                    current year Murari manages to accompany Gopamma to her parent's 
                    house.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                    this context we must know the relationship between Gopamma 
                    and Murari. Murari is the youngest brother of Gopamma's husband. 
                    But she treats Murari like her son. She even decides to go 
                    for abortion clandestinely so that she would not neglect once 
                    she has her own offspring. Murari calls her '<i>amma</i>' 
                    all the time.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
                    Sabari, who returns from her <i>Teerdha Yatra</i>, upon being 
                    informed by the family poojari that Murari is the one who 
                    would be subjected to death by Devi this year, refuses for 
                    the marriage. Then she reveals the dark secret that is kept 
                    under wraps that once in every 48 years, one of the family 
                    members are taken by Devi as <i>bali</i>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    rest of the story is about how Murari overcomes the curse 
                    by Devi and marries his sweetheart Vasundhara. To experience 
                    this beautiful scenic classic film by the creative genius 
                    Krishna Vamsi, you must watch this sensible musical love story 
                    on the silver screen with good audio equipment.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Performances:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Mahesh 
                    Babu:</b> Mahesh Babu, as a complete actor, did his role with 
                    zest. His mannerisms are straight take-off from that of Superstar 
                    Krishna's from Bapu's classic 'Saakshi'. We can see another 
                    avatar of Mahesh Babu in this film. He did not show off his 
                    manliness or heroism in this film. He confined his acting 
                    to the role specifications. You can see the character of Murari 
                    in this film, but not the heartthrob of millions of teenage 
                    girls Mahesh Babu. In this film, Mahesh used Mantra T-shirts 
                    extensively. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Sonali 
                    Bendre:</b> Krishna Vamsi told me that Tabu is only the alternative 
                    Heroine, who looks as sexily and sensuously in saree as Sridevi. 
                    He seems to have found a replacement for Sridevi and Sonali 
                    in the form of Sonali Bendre who looked as sexy and sensuous 
                    as Tabu and Sridevi. She is simply breath stopping in this 
                    by displayed all her cinematic charms in this film with instant 
                    spontaneity.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Lakshmi</b>: 
                    This film has two heroines. One is Laxmi and another one is 
                    Sonali Bendre. Everyone in the theater will fall in love with 
                    the benevolent character of Lakshmi. And she did full justice 
                    for her character and we cannot imagine any other actress 
                    doing that role.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Gollapudi and Satya Narayana</b>: It's quite refreshing 
                    to see Gollapudi and Kaikala Satyanarayana in this film. Both 
                    of them did excel in their roles and Satyanarayana being given 
                    more footage.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Editing, 
                    Story, Screenplay &amp; direction</b>: Another classical love 
                    story comes out of the genius Krishna Vamsi. For a change 
                    this time, Krishna Vamsi handled the onus of editing too in 
                    addition to story, screenplay and direction. Right from the 
                    frame one to the last scene, the mark of Krishna Vamsi is 
                    evident. Be it in canning the cute prank scenes between Murari 
                    and Vasundhara, or picturing the scenes containing the action 
                    of Gopamma (Laxmi), who remembers our own mother at house, 
                    who tends to get tears whenever she suspects anything that 
                    is going wrong. Though this is a slow paced love story, the 
                    violent touch of Krishna Vamsi is intact. Just like he did 
                    in Ninne Pelladatha (Where Nag slaps Tabu violently when she 
                    is about top die in the climax), Anthaputram (where Jagapathi 
                    Babu smokes a cigarette with gay abandon when he was shot 
                    with a bullet, this film to has Mahesh babu applying soil 
                    to the wounds in the climax.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Camera</b>: 
                    The photography is another bright asset of the film. Bhupati 
                    made that all the money spent in the production is visible 
                    on the screen. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                    Gopi Nandigam, has spend money unconditionally, all for his 
                    favorite hero Krishna's son. 80% of the film is shot with 
                    houses decorated using flowers and banana leaves.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                    Music is another assets of the film. The songs as well as 
                    the background music are equally good. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis:</b> 
                    The credit for the success or failure of this film should 
                    go to the Krishna Vamsi. He is the <i>Sri Krishna</i> of the 
                    film and Mahesh Babu is <i>Arjuna</i> of the film. <i>Arjuna</i> 
                    has followed all the instructions of <i>SriKrishna</i> with 
                    finesse of the perfect craftsman. Now, it's the audience turn 
                    to decide, weather Krishna Vamsi as <i>Srikrishna</i> did 
                    make his moves in the right direction or not. This film is 
                    bound get a little bit of dissent from the viewers of C class 
                    areas. But, this film is classic masterpiece for the class 
                    audience and highly recommended for the Mahesh and Krishnavamsi 
                    fans. In comparison, this film does not even come close to 
                    <i>Ninne Pelladatha</i>, though the storyline is similar except 
                    for the divine angle of it. This film will be a good fare 
                    for the people if they watch this film with no expectations. 
                    Just watch this film to experience Krishna Vamsi paint the 
                    silver screen with his classic strokes. </font></p>
