<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Janaki 
                    and Subhash are neighbors, who are friends from childhood. 
                    They move around very closely. Subhash is a freak-out guy 
                    and Janaki cares for him a lot. Chakri is Subhash elder brother, 
                    who is very responsible and on the way to fulfill his fathers 
                    dream of becoming a kickboxing champion. <br/>
<br/>
                    There is an age long rivalry between Model School and Govt. 
                    School in that town. Chakri, Subhash and Janaki belong to 
                    Govt. School. Rich and spoilt teenage boppers dominate the 
                    Model School. Bhupender is the gang leader of Model school 
                    and is hunted by Modern gals. <br/>
<br/>
                    Janaki loves Subhash. But Subhash has his eyes set on glossy 
                    modern gals. Bhupendar defeats Chakri, in the latest kick 
                    box annual competition. Meantime, Subhash hit off well with 
                    Lucky, as new entrant into Model school, by posing that he 
                    is born rich by borrowing latest cars from Janaki Fathers 
                    garage. Subhash used to lend lot of money from Janaki for 
                    his expenses. Before the valentine day, Subhash asks Janaki 
                    for Rs 10,000/- saying that he will present a diamond ring 
                    to his valentine. Janaki presumes her to be the valentine 
                    of Subhash and get the shock of her life when he presents 
                    that ring to Lucky in front of her. <br/>
<br/>
                    *Interval* <br/>
<br/>
                    Janaki decides to leave that town and go to her grannys place 
                    and do her study for the rest of life. Janaki father (Chandra 
                    Mohan) realizes that Janaki gave RS 10,000/- to Subhash. That 
                    was the last straw for him as he was very skeptical about 
                    Subhash behavior. Chandramohan give a oral thrashing to Subhash 
                    dad in public. Immediately Lucky come to know about the rags 
                    story of Subhash and thrashes him in front of his father. 
                    Being an insulted and harassed father he is, he sends Subhash 
                    out of his house. Janaki comes to know about the things that 
                    are happening to Subhash. So she cancels her trip and tries 
                    to comfort Subhash and explains him that what he was doing 
                    is bad. And makes him realize the importance of being a responsible 
                    person. As Subhash decides to mend his ways, things do turn 
                    out against him. <br/>
<br/>
                    Meantime, Subhash father settles the match for Chakri with 
                    Chakris longtime flame. As Chakri was going to get his brother 
                    home for his engagement, he was beaten up by Bhupendar and 
                    other model school guys. Chakri is so badly injured that he 
                    needs the bed rest for 3 months. In this process his fathers 
                    irritation towards Subhash multiplies. <br/>
<br/>
                    Subhash approaches the guru of chakri to learn the art of 
                    kickboxing. Janaki father settles an abroad match for Janaki 
                    and forces her to ignore Subhash, which she relents. As Subhash 
                    hones the finer points of martial arts, Janaki is left with 
                    an unavoidable option of having poison as she is sandwiched 
                    between fathers love and love for Subhash. <br/>
<br/>
                    Now stage is set for kickboxing. Will Janaki take poison? 
                    Will she get engaged to the abroad guy? How does Subhash manage 
                    to win the kickboxing championship as well as good will of 
                    his father. What is the ending etc. etc.  you must watch 
                    this electrifying movie on big screen with DTS stuff.</font></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Pawan Kalyan</b>: Pawan is in his elements. He acted extremely 
                  well in all the scenes, though some of the smiling stuff has 
                  the shades of Toli Prema. He danced very well. Oh man! This 
                  guy will beat Chiru in dances. Lot of hero image is projected 
                  in this movie for Pawan for which he did justice. <br/>
<b>Preeti</b>: This gal looks so cute. She did her job as an 
                  unconditional lover exceptionally well. She makes the viewers 
                  feel for her all the time. She did decent acting and has the 
                  girl-next-door portrayal. <br/>
<b>DR Aditi</b>; Though there is no scope for acting for this 
                  role, she did well with in the limitations. <br/>
<b>Achuth</b>: He did his role of a responsible brother with 
                  ease. Got applause by viewers in many scenes.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Director:</b> PA Arun Prasad is the new whiz kid of cinema 
                  with Thammudu. He belongs to the league of Jayant and Krishna 
                  Vamsi. He did a fabulous job. Though this film has lots of fun 
                  stuff, song and dances, director made sure that the undercurrent 
                  of love and sentiment through the film is present. He did extremely 
                  well in showing the human values and feelings of each and every 
                  character.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Screenplay:</b> Screenplay of this film is neat and clean. 
                  Each scene is fresh and new.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Producer:</b> Burugapalli sivarama Krishna gave another classic 
                  movie after Premante idera. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Dialogues:</b> Ramana Chintapally, who gave cute dialogues 
                  for Toli Prema, came up with yet another great performance. 
                  <br/>

                  No1: College Blues</b>: This western part of this lullaby 
                  is pictured on Model School guys. Folk part of it is pictured 
                  on Govt. College guys. This lullaby is a short and sensual stuff.<br/>
<br/>
<b> Song No2: Made in Andhra</b>: This song is about Pawan 
                  showing modern collegiate his power. Superb steps by Pawan. 
                  <br/>
<br/>
<b> Song No3: Pedavi daatani</b>: This classic song is pictured 
                  in the Alps of Switzerland. There is no dance in this song. 
                  There are a few sweet things in this song that tickles the viewers 
                  heart. This song is about Preeti imagining about sharing her 
                  sweet nothings with Pawan. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Song No4: Edola Vundi</b>: This song comes when Pawan 
                  got just introduced to DR Aditi. A sensual song. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Song No5: Vayyari Bhama</b>: This song is shot in Switzerland 
                  railway station with Pawan donning coolie dress. The funniest 
                  part of this song is that 5 blond guys would be folk dancing 
                  as sidekicks to Pawan wearing a Lungi. By listening to this 
                  song one do expect more in picturization. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Song No6: Kalakalalu</b>: Pawan imagining himself singing 
                  an engagement song for his brother. There is family dance in 
                  this as well as few exceptionally excellent dancing steps by 
                  Pawan. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Song No7: Traveling Soldier</b>: A song which was pictured 
                  with such an extraordinary skill that one has to sit on the 
                  edge of chair to see those martial feats of Pawan. Very inspirational 
                  stuff it is.</font></td>

<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First 
                  half is full freak out. Second half grabs the viewers and make 
                  them follow every scene closely. Story is thin, but the treatment 
                  is cool. There is freshness in each and every scene. Even when 
                  he don a role of brat in first half, Pawan captures the hearts 
                  of viewers with his lighter vein comedy. Highlight of this film 
                  is the climax (kickboxing). There is deafening applause from 
                  the viewers for this climax. You will really get confused about 
                  where you are getting those sounds, from sound box or from viewers. 
                  There are two more cute lullabies in this movie, which were 
                  enjoyed thoroughly by viewers. This film showcases the multitalented 
                  acting prowess of Pawan. Debutante director P A Prasad is bound
