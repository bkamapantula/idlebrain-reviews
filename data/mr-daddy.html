                    Ashima is looking out for a bike-expect model to star in an 
                    advertisement. She gets hold of Raj Kumar (Chiranjeevi) and 
                    makes him act in her ad apposite her and she falls in love 
                    with Raj Kumar. When Raj Kumar rejects her love, she opts 
                    for a suicide. When she is admitted in the hospital, Prasad 
                    (Rejendra Prasad) tells her the flashback of Raj Kumar.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&lt;begin 
                    of flash back&gt;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Raj 
                    Kumar runs a dance school and an audio manufacturing company. 
                    His dance school is meant to satisfy his zeal for dancing 
                    and audio company is meant for earning his bread and butter. 
                    He falls in love with Shanti (Simran) and gets married to 
                    her. Shanti gives birth to Akshaya (baby Akshaya). Akshaya 
                    is very fond of her daddy. Raj Kumar is very fond of his friends. 
                    He gives surety for the Chit Fund Company of his friend. His 
                    friend ditches Raj Kumar and his entire property is confiscated. 
                    Later on, it is revealed that Akshaya is having a heart disease. 
                    Raj Kumar needs 4 lakhs to get Akshaya operated and all his 
                    friends hesitate to help him with the money. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ultimately 
                    Raj Kumar lands up in jail after confrontation with a friend 
                    who ditched him. Meanwhile, Akshaya at hospital expires. Santhi 
                    claims that Raj Kumar is responsible for the demise of their 
                    kid. Santhi leaves Raj Kumar and decides to live alone. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&lt;end 
                    of flash back&gt;</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Raj 
                    Kumar builds a hospital on name of Akshaya and lives an anonymous 
                    life as volunteer in that foundation. After coming to know 
                    the pathetic flashback of Raj Kumar, Ashima decides to help 
                    him out.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later 
                    on, to his amazement, Raj Kumar finds another girl who is 
                    Akshaya look-alike (baby Akshaya again) and comes to know 
                    that she is the daughter of Shanti. Shanti was pregnant when 
                    she left Raj Kumar and Raj Kumar was unaware of that fact. 
                    Shanti does not want the kid to know about her father. Raj 
                    Kumar wants to get back the kid along with Shanti.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    rest of the film is about how all the ends well.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Performances:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Chiranjeevi:</b> 
                    Chiranjeevi did an excellent job as Daddy in this film. He 
                    shed some weight compared to Mrigaraju. His new looks are 
                    good. But his character lacks the heroism one expects from 
                    Chiranjeevi. His role in this film is much more softer than 
                    that of 'Iddaru Mitrulu'.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baby 
                    Akshaya:</b> She is very cute in this film and all the scenes 
                    involving baby Akshaya hit well with the audiences. Baby Akshaya 
                    must be commended for her sweet action in this film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Simran:</b> 
                    Simran looks weary. She did wonderful job as the protagonist 
                    in this film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Ashima 
                    Bhalla</b>: Ashima did a small role which confines to two 
                    songs and she did well within the limitations.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rajendra 
                    Prasad</b>: Rajendra Prasad's talent is wasted in this film. 
                    There is absolutely no scope for comedy for his character.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments:</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Story</b>: 
                    The main drawback of this film is inane story. One would wonder 
                    why Chiranjeevi has accepted a story that has striking similarities 
                    to Mrigaraju. In both these films, the second half is concentrated 
                    more on Chiranjeevi trying to win the heart of Simran and 
                    baby. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Screenplay 
                    and direction</b>: The touch of Suresh Krishna is conspicuously 
                    missing in this film. The direction of the film is not up 
                    to the expectations. The screenplay is shabby. The scenes 
                    does come one by one, but what they lack is the screenplay 
                    that makes the viewer attentive and inquisitive about what 
                    is coming in the next scene. The master of flashbacks, Suresh 
                    Krishna, could not render his successful narration for this 
                    film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                    Songs of the film sound good after a repetitive listening. 
                    The background music of the film is good.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    Photography by Chota K Naidu is a big asset in the film. Each 
                    and every frame of the movie looks rich and refreshing.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dialogues: 
                    The dialogues lack the substance. Satyanand, who has written 
                    witty dialogues for Annayya, has disappointed the audience 
                    with plain dialogues in Daddy.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Comedy: 
                    The main drawback of this film is lack of comedy. Only the 
                    scenes involving the combination of Akshaya and Chiranjeevi 
                    in the second half provides some comic relief. The comedy 
                    artists like Rajendra Prasad, Kota and MS Narayana are not 
                    utilized.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Songs: 
                    The songs in second half are good. Here is the sequence of 
                    songs. Like Kushi, this film too had three popular English 
                    song bits for which Chiru dances in the first half. </font></p>
<ol>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Aadu 
                      Adinchu: This song comes as the beginning of the flashback. 
                      It's a solo song canned in sets on stunningly dressed Chiru. 
                      He has done some excellent steps for this song. This song 
                      evoked very good cheers from the crowds.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Naa 
                      Praanama Suswagatam: This slow song is shot in abroad on 
                      Simran and Chiru.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Gummadi 
                      Gummadi: This slow song comes in parts for three times in 
                      this film. All these three scenes do have three different 
                      moods and different lyrics. </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Vana 
                      Vana: This song is the highlight of the film. It is shot 
                      in sets on Chiru, Ashima and baby Akshaya. The sets done 
                      for this song are really good. This songs reminds the viewers 
                      of rain song in 'Gharana Mogudu'</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Patta 
                      Pakkinti: This song is shot on Chiru, Ashima and Simran. 
                      It's an imagination song canned on a set.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Mandara 
                      Buggallo: This final song is a masti song shot on Chiru 
                      and Simran in abroad.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fights</b>: 
                    There is only one fight in this film. That's too a fun fight 
                    composed by Pawan Kalyan. But it is not up to the hype that 
                    was created during prerelease days. Another chase scene composed 
                    by Pawan Kalyan is pretty interesting and evokes lot of response.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis:</b> 
                    First half of this film is average. The second half is good 
                    in the beginning. It's high time for Chiru to sign the films 
                    with good script rather than going for the famed directors 
                    like Suresh Krishna, who seems to have lost the ammunition 
                    in his direction. Have no expectations and watch this film, 
                    you might like it. This film is better than Mrigaraju and 
                    not as good as Annayya. We have to wait and see how the viewers, 
                    especially the family ladies, like this film in the weeks 
                    to come as this film is heavily banking on the 'sentiment' 
                    factor!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>An 
                    afterthought</b>: Chiranjeevi should ponder over encouraging 
                    new directors with fresh thoughts. New directors can concentrate 
                    more on the script with devotion as they have a thing to prove. 
                    Going after seasoned directors can only jeopardize his career. 
                    Chiranjeevi is always known for his humbleness and has a willing 
                    attitude to face criticism, admit mistakes and learn from 
                    the past experiences. May be he would accept films with good 
                    scripts in the future.</font></p>
