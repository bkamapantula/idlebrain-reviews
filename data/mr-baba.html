<br/>
                    The film opens with the birth of Baba, who is a '<i>baba amsa 
                    sambhootudu</i>'. Baba (Rajnikanth) grows up as an atheist, 
                    hot-blooded guy and a Good Samaritan. His life style includes 
                    consuming alcohol, smoking beedi, chewing paan parag, His 
                    mother (Sujatha) and his maternal uncle are ardent devotees 
                    of Baba (the Baba who is supposed to be of 2000 years old 
                    and who live in Himalayas). Chamundeswari (Manisha Koirala) 
                    stays in the neighborhood of Baba and both of them fall in 
                    love. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Baba 
                    beats the son of a state minister Krishna Murthy (Asish Vidyardhi). 
                    Krishna Murthy demolishes the colony of Baba. When Baba is 
                    about to go to fight with Krishna Murthy, Baba's mother urges 
                    him to maintain calm and rebuild lost colony it by working 
                    hard. Baba joins as a labor in a shop and earns money. Chamundeswari 
                    tells Baba that she is not willing to marry a daily labor. 
                    Then Baba realizes that so far he has been only answerable 
                    for his mother. And if he gets married then he has to live 
                    for wife and kids. And he would become answerable to them. 
                    He would not be able to help for the society as he might become 
                    selfish after marriage. He feels that <i>prema</i> (love) 
                    is <i>maya</i> (illusion). At that time, a weird looking sadhu 
                    comes to him and tell him that its time for getting enlightened. 
                    Baba is taken to Himalayas where he meets the real Baba. He 
                    gets frightened by the atmosphere and wishes to return back 
                    to Chennai. Then real Baba grants 7 wishes to Baba. He can 
                    use any of these wishes anytime he wishes to utilize. Baba 
                    is sent back to Chennai. Baba still could not believe that 
                    he went to Himalayas met real Baba. He uses that mantra to 
                    test the power by wishing a flying kite to come and fall in 
                    his hand. He waits for a few seconds and decide that it was 
                    all his illusion. Later the kite follows him to his house 
                    and falls on his hand. He feels that its coincidental and 
                    tries the mantra again to a different kite and wishes it to 
                    fall on his lap. He goes into his house and close all the 
                    possible entries in the house. But the kite makes its way 
                    falls on his lap. That is where he realizes that Baba is real 
                    and God exists in the world. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
                    still has five more wishes life. And the minister Krishna 
                    Murthy comes to know about it. They call a tantrik (Amrish 
                    Puri) to foil the Baba's magic powers. What happens in the 
                    end and what is the message Baba wants to give to the public 
                    are the interesting points that are dealt towards the end 
                    of the film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists</b>:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rajnikanth</b>: 
                    Rajni had a light beard in this film to give a carefree image 
                    to the characterization. Rajni's name is associated with the 
                    style and he performed each and every moment of Baba character 
                    with great élan. Rajni's introduction is shown with 
                    the song '<a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.teluguzine.com/audio/baba2.html','Mrugaraju','width=200,height=280')">Tippu 
                    Tippu</a>', in a railway station set. He also did different 
                    dances for the songs '<a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.teluguzine.com/audio/baba3.html','Mrugaraju','width=200,height=280')">Baba 
                    .. Neeku Mokkuta</a>' and '<a href="#" onclick="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.teluguzine.com/audio/baba4.html','Mrugaraju','width=200,height=280')">Maya 
                    Maya</a>' in the dance direction of Prabhudeva and Lawrance 
                    respectively. His mannerism in the film is saying '<i>Gatham 
                    Gatham</i>' (past is past) by showing his trademark Baba symbol 
                    (see the image of Baba). Another interesting mannerism is 
                    giving shake-hand to his pal for every dialogue he or his 
                    friends crack.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Manisha 
                    Koirala &amp; Sanghavi</b>: Manisha has a little part to play 
                    in the first half and has almost-nil footage in the second 
                    half. Shanghavi is just a prop in this film with a couple 
                    of dialogues to tell.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Technical 
                    Departments</b></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Story 
                    - Screenplay</b>: The basic story of the film is good. Its 
                    about how an atheist turned into a believer in God! It's based 
                    on lots of devotional tales where the greatest devotees of 
                    God started their life as atheists. But the screenplay of 
                    the film is not smooth and very slow. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Director</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>:</b> 
                    Suresh Krishna, who is known for narrating stories with power 
                    and punch, could not maintain the same tempo in this film. 
                    Some of the scenes in the film are brilliant and Suresh Krishna 
                    mastered the art of showing Rajni to a glorifying effect. 
                    But the magnification becomes more effective if he has the 
                    narration supporting it. But, Suresh Krishna failed to sustain 
                    the interest of viewers throughout the film.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Dialogues</b>: 
                    Dialogues department in this film needs a special commendation. 
                    There are some power-packed dialogues in Baba like - '<i>aalochinchakundaa 
                    matladanu .. matladina tarvatha aalochinchanu</i>'.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Music</b>: 
                    The songs of the film are disappointment. But the background 
                    music is good. The westernized Baba rap bit that is played 
                    at background, when Rajni walks around is very good. AR Rehman's 
                    work could have been better</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Photography</b>: 
                    Photography by Chota K Naidu is good. The special effects 
                    done by Cutting Edge are also very suave and make you believe 
                    that those effects are natural.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Production</b>: 
                    Rajnikanth's intention of mixing the Indian philosophy with 
                    mass elements is commendable. At the end of the film Rajni 
                    asks the Baba to tell him what everybody should do to have 
                    a harmony in society. Baba replies Rajni 3 principles</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. <i>Manasu 
                      mariyu Tanuvu parisubramga vundali </i>(You should keep 
                      your body and heart very clean).<br/>
                      2. <i>Kutmbanni eppudu anandamgaa vunchali.</i> (one must 
                      keep his/her family very happy)<br/>
                      3. <i>Itarulaku Vupakaram Chellayi. Upakaramcheyykapoyina 
                      parledu kaani .. apakaram cheyyakoodadu.</i> (One must help 
                      the society. Even if you don't help society, you should 
                      never harm it).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But, Rajni 
                    should have made an out and out mass film for the entertainment 
                    of crowds. And could have told these three points in some 
                    other format using other media, as he has the same reach if 
                    he wishes to propagate these points in other format as well. 
                    . </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Analysis</b>: 
                    <br/>
                    First half of the film is OK. Second half is average. There 
                    are some boring moments in the second half. There are political 
                    references about the mistakes done by the politicians and 
                    their apathy towards helping the poor. These kinds of references 
                    work well for the Tamilnadu crowds as that depicts the current 
                    situation of Tamilnadu where masses want to see Rajni in the 
                    seat of CM. For all its strengths and weaknesses, this film 
                    is definitely worth a watch for Ranji's style and mannerisms. 
                    We have to wait and see how it clicks with AP crowds.</font></p>
