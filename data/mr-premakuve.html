<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Venkata 
                    Narayana (Prakash Raj) is one of the biggest business tycoons 
                    in India having a personal net worth of Rs 2,500 crores. His 
                    motto of life is 'Dare to dream and Care to achieve'. His 
                    only daughter is Madhavi (soundarya). <br/>
<br/>
                    Movie starts with Venkata Narayana explaining the viewers 
                    about his hard work and way of living. His daughter Madhavi 
                    is arriving from states after doing her MBA. He wanted to 
                    make her the MD for his companies. But Madhavi tells him that 
                    she wanted to join as a clerk in his firm and learn the tricks 
                    of trade and slowly take over Venkata Narayana post when she 
                    is ready. Venkata Narayana likes her idea and he appoints 
                    his own daughter (Madhavi alias Malathi) as a clerk in his 
                    office for a monthly salary of RS 2,500/-. She stays on her 
                    own in a flat paying up RS 250/-( Do you get one in Hyderabad?). 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    Manohar (Chakri) just finished his B.com. Manohar comes to 
                    know that Venkata Narayana is none but his own maternal uncle. 
                    Then he chooses the easy way out to become a filth rich millionaire. 
                    That is to marry the daughter of Venkata Narayara, Miss Madhavi. 
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    On his way to Hyderabad, Manohar skillfully rescues a pregnant, 
                    who happened to be the friend of Madhavi. As expected Manohar 
                    nonchalantly leaves the train without making any advances 
                    to Madhavi though she attracted him with her charms as all 
                    he has in his mind is maradalu. <br/>
<br/>
                    Scene shifts to Venkata Narayana's house where Manohar demands 
                    his mama to get him married to Madhavi. An irritated person 
                    he is, Venkata Narayana appoint Chakri as a Dispatching Clerk 
                    in his Organization. <br/>
<br/>
                    Manohar gets surprised by knowing that the beautiful girl 
                    he met in train is working at the same office. He meets his 
                    college time bum chum Raviteja as the canteen owner for the 
                    same office. He puts up his stay with Raviteja. Obviously 
                    Malathi is staying in the ground floor of the same building 
                    in which these guys are staying. <br/>
<br/>
                    When Manohar and Ravi Teja overhear the telephonic conversation 
                    by Malathi to her Dad, they come to know that Malathi is none 
                    but Madhavi. Then the inevitable thing happens and they fall 
                    in love. Madhavi confesses to Venkata Narayana that she is 
                    in love with Manohar. Then Venkata Narayana tells her that 
                    Manohar is her bava and Manohar is interested in her money 
                    than herself. Madhavi refuses to accept the allegation by 
                    her father and she tells him that she will prove that Manohar 
                    is not after money. <br/>
<br/>
                    She perform a drama to convey the message to Manohar and Ravi 
                    Teja that she is a daughter of fisherman. Manohar fails to 
                    acknowledge his love to her after he realizes that she is 
                    a daughter of a poor man. He confesses her that he is here 
                    to marry the daughter of Venkata Narayana, but not Malathi. 
                    He expresses his love and obsession for money. <br/>
<br/>
                    Madhavi has two choices now. One is to go back to her father 
                    and accept her defeat. Second one is to change Manohar. She 
                    decides to do both. She meets Venkata Narayana and tells him 
                    that Manohar is a money minded man. She asks him to give her 
                    a chance to change Manohar. They fix 31st December 1999 (Y2K 
                    problem?) as the deadline. <br/>
<br/>
                    Meantime Manohar loses his job as DC in Venkata Narayana company. 
                    Inspired by a spirited speech by Malathi, he decides to do 
                    his own consultancy by giving solutions (ideas) to the CEO's 
                    who are facing labor and marketing problems (a la chiru in 
                    'challenge' and rajendra prasad in 'a okkati adakku'). Still 
                    he believe in money and the charm of the 'Daughter of Venkata 
                    Narayana', whom he thinks he did not found. Manohar in turn 
                    upsets the apple cart of Venkata Narayana by making the strategic 
                    marketing deals with Venkata Narayana's business rivals. Now 
                    Venkata Narayana decides to come even with Manohar and promises 
                    him that he will give his daughter to Manohar and that grand 
                    announcement of this news would be done at 31st December night 
                    bash. <br/>
<br/>
                    Enter the comedy oriented sweet villain Surya (of Sundhuram 
                    and Thammudu fame). Surya is the brother of Venkata Narayana's 
                    wife. Surya is willing to marry Madhavi ( its funny that he 
                    too do not know how Madhavi looks like). This film crazy, 
                    director aspirant, Surya follows Venkata Narayana and webs 
                    a hypothetical story around the incidents and concludes that 
                    Manohar is the villain of the entire episode (he thinks Madhavi 
                    is the Vamp of story). <br/>
<br/>
                    It's 31st December 1999. Mid night is fast approaching. As 
                    he is the Hero, Surya kidnaps Manohar and keeps him in his 
                    dungeon and go to attend the mid night bash thrown by Venkata 
                    Narayana. As the clock is fast approaching to the midnight 
                    hours, we are left with a nail biting suspense. Will Manohar 
                    comes to attend the bash by bashing the guys who kidnapped 
                    him? If he managed to come to party, will he accept to marry 
                    the daughter of Venkata Narayana? Well guys! You gotta watch 
                    this comedy entertainer to know the climax. </font></p>

                  Actors: <br/>
<br/>
                  Chakri: </b>Characters of this type are Chakri's forte. He did 
                  his role with the ease. <br/>
<b> Soundarya:</b> Though this role has limited scope for performance, 
                  Soundarya did her bit with perfection. <br/>
<b> Prakash Raj:</b> He donned a role that is very inspirational 
                  and gives sugar coated message tablets. His scenes with Brahmanandam 
                  makes viewers laugh their heart out. <br/>
<b> Brahmanandam:</b> He makes us date back to the days of 'Yama 
                  Leela' and 'Vinodam' with his performance in this film. <br/>
<b> Ravi Teja:</b> He did his bit with natural charm. Its very 
                  refreshing to see Ravi Teja at his natural best like his role 
                  in 'Manasichi Choodu'. <br/>
<b> Sri Hari:</b> He is given a role of absent minded General 
                  Manager. Though his role has very less span in this movie, when 
                  ever he was shown viewers have a sigh of anticipating comic 
                  relief. <br/>
<b> Surya:</b> This guy can become another 'Prakash Raj' in 
                  the months to come. Its an exhilarating experience to see him 
                  in a comic role after seeing him in serious roles as Naxalite 
                  in Sindhuram and Kick Boxing Guru in Thammudu. Especially while 
                  narrating his story line 'akka - bava - attha - mama'. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Direction:</b> SV Krishna Reddy is back in his elements. 
                  After 'Vinodam', he did it again with lot of humor and an undercurrent 
                  message. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Production:</b> Taranga Subramanyam seems to have done his 
                  first foray in to film production with proper home work. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Dialogues:</b> Dialogues are the life line of this film. 
                  Punching, yet sensible dialogues are written by Divakar Babu. 
                  Hilarious conversations beween Brahmanandam and Prakash Raj 
                  shows the hall mark of writer's ability to write humorous dialogues. 
                  So is the case with Surya dialogues. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Story:</b> This is a typical 'Suryadevara Rama Mohana Rao' 
                  story. His typical theme of Rags to Riches is shown with an 
                  under current message. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Music:</b> This foot tapping typical SV Krishna Reddy's 
                  music was well received by viewers. <br/>
<br/>
<b> Songs:</b> All song are well canned. </font></td>
