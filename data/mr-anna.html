<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This film 
                    starts with Rajaram(Chiranjeevi) doing a fight with the labor 
                    exploiter (Bhupendar). As they fight their muscles out, the 
                    damsel of the town Devi, a garment manufacturer, falls in 
                    love with Rajaram at first sight. After a preliminary fight 
                    and sensuous introduction between the lead pair we come to 
                    know that Rajaram is a owner of 40 lorries and is the person 
                    who came up in life with pure hardwork and the unmatched professionalism.<br/>
<br/>
                    Devi's love towards him grows after knowing the background 
                    of Rajara</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">m. 
                    As Devi is experiencing the feeling being in love with a manly 
                    guy for the first time, our Rajaram has a twin to talk with 
                    and share his feeling. That guy is the whacky <i>Atmaram(Chiranjeevi)</i>. 
                    As and when Rajaram needs some tips in love, our Atmaram appears 
                    from nowhere to help him out. Then the first song of the film, 
                    'Himaseemallo Hello' follows. Canned in the picturesque locales 
                    of Newzealand, this song has got few sensible slow steps.<br/>
<br/>
                    After the song is over, Rajaram's home is shown. That is a 
                    closely knitted family consisting of three brothers (Rajaram, 
                    Krishna and Gopi) and an elderly <i>babai</i> (Kota Sreenivasa 
                    Rao). Rajaram's parents expired at an early stage. Hence Rajaram 
                    brought up his brothers with uttermost care and unending love.<br/>
<br/>
                    Being the pampered kids, its natural that the younger brothers 
                    turn out to be wayward. They start teasing the sisters(Sishwa 
                    and Chandini) of Devi. After a few petty quarrels, they realize 
                    that they are in love with each other.<br/>
<br/>
                    Rajaram and Devi had taken vow (individually) to not get married 
                    till their siblings marriage is over. After knowing that his 
                    brothers are in love with the sisters of Devi, Rajaram visits 
                    Devi's place to talk to</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
                    her about his plans for brothers marriage. Thinking that Rajaram 
                    came to express his love to her, Devi treats Rajaram in a 
                    special way. But when she realizes that Rajaram's intention 
                    is to marry the Devi's sisters off to his brothers, her mood 
                    takes an U turn. She tells Rajaram boldly that she is unwilling 
                    let her sisters marry drunkards. Rajaram tries to convince 
                    Devi, in vein. Rajaram tells Devi that his brothers will marry 
                    her sisters anyway! <br/>
<br/>
                    *Interval*<br/>
<br/>
<i>Babai</i> gives Rajaram a realistic picture about the notorious 
                    reputation Rajaram's younger brothers are carrying in the 
                    town. And makes him realize that he should try out something 
                    to change the attitude of his brothers. Rajaram takes his 
                    brothers to a temple on his birthday and makes them vow that 
                    they would never touch the liquor again.<br/>
<br/>
                    Rajaram makes his brothers work in his lorry office and makes 
                    them won the laurels of Devi. After a thorough testing and 
                    inspection, Devi decides to make the arrangements for the 
                    wedding of her siblings with that of Rajaram. Its anybody's 
                    guess that this scene is followed a family song(bavalu ....). 
                    When the engagement ceremony is about to take off, the brothers 
                    of Rajaram falls prey to the sentimental luring of their friends 
                    and imbibe the liquor. When they attended the ceremony in 
                    a state of inebriation, the hell breaks loose that is followed 
                    by Devi walking out in a huff with her sisters and Rajaram 
                    beating his brothers with a leather belt. Rajaram throws his 
                    brothers out of his house.<br/>
<br/>
                    The pampered little kids finds it hard to survive on their 
                    own. Slowly they start a small garage to repair cars. A car 
                    manufacturer spots these buds and employs them as modeling 
                    engineers in his car manufacturing unit. Rajaram comes to 
                    know about the progress his brothers are making and feels 
                    very happy about it.<br/>
<br/>
                    When Rajaram meets the car manufacturer to offer his wishes, 
                    he comes to know that car manufacturer needs a couple of crores 
                    to produce the car designed by the brothers of Rajaram. Rajaram 
                    sells off all his property and lends car manufacturer money 
                    without taking any surety(is something fishy?)<br/>
<br/>
                    There after the raise of brothers of Rajaram is meteoric and 
                    fall of Rajaram is pathetic. At the end, this story takes 
                    some expected twists to end well. You have to watch it for 
                    yourself to find out the climax.</font></p>

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Artists:</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>Chiranjeevi:</b> No introduction is needed to tell how good 
                  Chiru is at emoting. He went for a Giant kill. Comedy, Fights, 
                  Sentimental Scenes and Dances .. you got them all done by Chiru 
                  with enterprising energy. Comedy in the first half is excellent. 
                  The character of atmaram gives viewers a cause to celebrate. 
                  <br/>
<b>Soundarya:</b> She did her role as a responsible elder sister 
                  well. At the same time she is at her glamour best when it comes 
                  to hip shaking with Chiru in the songs.<br/>
<b>Venkat &amp; Raviteja:</b> Their role have nothing to offer. 
                  They did their bit with total commitment. Venkat is slightly 
                  on a backfoot as for as the dialogue delivery is concerned. 
                  Raviteja fitted the bill best.<br/>
<b>Bhupendar:</b> Looks like the director preferred Bhupendar 
                  to add the much needed fights to the film. The introductory 
                  fight is simply superb.<br/>
<b>Kota:</b> Its a pleasure to watch Kota in full flow. He is 
                  not seen in many movies off late.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Story</b>: The week point of the film is story. There is 
                  no story in the first half and the story is second half is very 
                  predictable.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Direction:</b> Muthyala Subbaiah's mark of sentiment is missing. 
                  He seems to have got carried away by projecting the charisma 
                  of Chiranjeevi and there by concentrating less on sensible narration 
                  of story. There is no heavy sentiment in this film.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Dialogues:</b> Dialogues are good. But there are some double 
                  entendre dialogues by Chiru in the first half, which makes the 
                  viewer feel uncomfortable.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music:</b> Music of the film is the biggest plus point. All 
                  the six songs are very catchy.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Songs:</b> Choreography for this film is extraordinary. The 
                  first song('<a href="http://jeevistud.tripod.com/anna-2.rm">Himagiri 
                  Sogasullo </a>') is pictured in the luster locales of Newzeland. 
                  Second song, <a href="http://jeevistud.tripod.com/anna-1.rm">Sayyare 
                  Sayya</a>, is a unique gift to all Chiru fans. This song has 
                  a backdrop of tankbund. Third song of the film, <a href="http://jeevistud.tripod.com/anna-4.rm">Vana 
                  Vana Vallappa</a>, is a rain song that is canned in a huge set. 
                  Fourth song is the family song, '<a href="http://jeevistud.tripod.com/anna-5.rm">bavalu</a>', 
                  is pictured in Sanjeevayya park. Fifth song, the trump card 
                  of the film, '<a href="http://jeevistud.tripod.com/anna-6.rm">Aaata 
                  Kavala</a>' with Chiru and sensuous Simmi is taken in a dhaba 
                  set. The final song, '<a href="http://jeevistud.tripod.com/anna-3.rm">gusa 
                  gusale</a>', is another treat to watch and is pictured in Newzealand.<br/>

<tr>
<td colspan="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                  film has got two main characters ..... Rajaram and Devi. Both 
                  characters love each other. Both have a similar background and 
                  a similar responsibility. This story works out well if the sanctity 
                  of these two characters is maintained. Whenever Rajaram confronts 
                  Devi in the first half of the film, he would be supporting his 
                  brothers. That's too in a childish way (may be the director 
                  want to show that Rajaram Character is good at Comedy). In that 
                  process the characterization of 'Rajaram' has taken a beating. 
                  There by the stature of 'Devi' character was elevated. One cant 
                  afford to see a noble guy like 'Rajaram' uttering suggestive 
                  words to Devi. <br/>
<br/>
                  First half of the film is enterprising though there is no story 
                  and the narration is random. Second half of the film do not 
                  have much to offer. You can feel the director's grip on the 
                  story in the last 20 minutes. That's the reason why there was 
                  more applause for the last song 'Gusagusale' from the viewers 
                  compared to the biggies 'Sayyare Sayya' and 'Aaata Kavaala'.<br/>
<br/>
                  Touted as the full-length mass character for Chiru after 'Gharana 
                  Mogudu and 'Muta mestri', 'Rajaram' character has all the shades 
                  of a mass hero. But the comedy touch that is given to his role 
                  in first half might lessen the impact of Rajaram Role. One can't 
                  expect the 'Rajaram' role to have 'double meaning' dialogues. 
                  Looks like Chiranjeevi tried to show his towering mass persona 
                  through the Rajaram character. There is a surprise in store 
                  for the viewers as Chiru has a double role in the film. One 
                  is 'Rajaram' and another is a funky 'Atmaram'. <br/>
<br/>
                  Our suggestion to Chiru is not to accept roles like 'Rajaram' 
                  anymore. This film may become a superhit. But this sort of trend 
                  will seduce him into the same vicious circle he was drawn after 
                  'Gharana Mogudu'. Ironically, there is a dialogue by <i>Atmaram</i> 
                  that he (read Megastar Chiranjeevi) has become BIG because of 
                  the mass appeal. But without a good storyline one cannot expect 
                  the film to become a winner unless it has got some extraordinary 
                  narration and ultimate screenplay. We have to wait and see how 
                  the masses respond to this full length mass film. </font></td>
